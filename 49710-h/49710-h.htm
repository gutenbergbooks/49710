<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
"'Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no
more cakes and ale ... nor ginger hot i' the mouth?' Or
knowest not that while man, casting the dice with Fate and Mistress
Grundy, imagineth a new luck, there shall be new comedy?
Why, then, reprint these old?"</p>

<p>In part, because the comedies of a nation are for literature as
well as for the footlights, and literature, in most cases, begins after
the footlights are out. In part, because old comedies make good
reading, not only for lovers of fiction and the stage, but for the
student of society and the historian. Until rival forms of literary
art began to usurp their function, comedies were&mdash;in England, not
to speak of other and older lands&mdash;the recognized and cherished
exponent of the successive phases of contemporary life. For us
they still are living sketches of the social manners, morals, vanities,
and ideals of generations of our ancestors; history "unbeknownst"
as written by contemporaries. Unfortunately, many of these old
comedies are inaccessible to the public; and, therefore, we venture
to hope that the general reader may find such a collection as the
present acceptable, whether he care to enter upon a historical and
technical study of the subject or not.</p>

<p>To the student of literary history, however, this series will, we
trust, justify its existence for quite another reason. For the aim
of this volume and those which will follow is to indicate the
development of a literary type by a selection of its representative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
specimens, arranged in the order of their production and accompanied
by critical and historical studies. So little has been scientifically
determined concerning evolution or permutation in literature
that the more specific the field of inquiry, the more trustworthy
are the results attained,&mdash;hence the limitation of this research not
merely to a genus like the drama, but to one of its species. What
is here presented to the public differs from histories of the drama in
that it is more restricted in scope and that it substantiates the narrative
of a literary growth by reproducing the data necessary to an
induction; it differs from editions of individual plays and dramatists,
on the other hand, because it attempts to concatenate its texts
by a running commentary upon the characteristics of the species
under consideration as they successively appear. It is an illustrated,
if not certified, history of English comedy.</p>

<p>The plays, in this series called representative, have been chosen
primarily for their importance in the history of comedy, generally
also for their literary quality, and, when possible, for their practical,
dramatic, or histrionic value. Of the studies accompanying them,
some are special, such as those dealing with the several authors and
plays; some general, the monographs upon groups or movements,
and the sketch introductory to the volume. The essay prefatory
to a play includes, when possible, an outline of the dramatist's life, a
concise history of his contribution to comedy, with reference, when
appropriate, to his productions in other fields, an estimate of his
output in its relation to the national, social, literary, and technical
development of the type in question, and to such foreign movements
and influences as may be cognate, and, finally, an exposition
and criticism of the play presented. By the insertion in proper
chronological position of occasional monographs, it is intended to
represent minor dramatists or groups of the same school, period, or
movement,&mdash;sometimes, indeed, an author of exceptional importance,&mdash;in
such a way that the historical continuity of the species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
may be as evident in its minor manifestations as in the better
known. The general introductions to these volumes will usually
attempt to discuss matters of historical interest not covered by
the editors of special portions of the work. It has been necessary,
therefore, to open the series, in this book, with an historical view
of the beginnings of comedy in England. While the various contributors
to the enterprise have exercised their individual preferences
in matters of literary treatment, judgment, and style, the general
editor has attempted to secure the requisite degree of uniformity by
requesting each to conform so far as his taste and historical conscience
might permit to a common but elastic outline of method
previously prepared. If the attempt has succeeded, there has been
gained something of continuity and scientific value for the series.
The presence, at the same time, of an occasional personal element
in the several articles of the history will enhance its value for our
dear friend, the good old-fashioned reader, who sets no store by
literary science, but judges books by his liking, and likes to read
such judgments of them.</p>

<p>The texts of the comedies presented are, to the best ability of
their respective editors, faithful reprints of the best originals; where
possible, those published during the authors' lives. Spelling and
language have been preserved as they were; but for the convenience
of readers, the punctuation and the style of capitals and
letters, such as <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>s</i>, have been, unless otherwise specified,
conformed to the modern custom.</p>

<p>The general editor regrets that it has not been feasible to preface
the series with some of the still earlier experiments in comedy,
but he indulges the hope that such a volume may later be added,
and, also, that it may soon be possible to publish in its proper proportions
the materials which have been condensed into the <i>Historical
View</i> here submitted. He takes this opportunity to express his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
appreciation of the courtesy of the scholars who have engaged with
him in this undertaking, and especially to thank Mr. Pollard of the
British Museum, and Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson of the Bodleian
Library, Professor Gummere, Professor Dowden, and the Master
of Peterhouse for assistance, encouragement, and counsel which
have contributed to make this labour a delight. Other volumes of
this series are well under way, and will follow with all reasonable
celerity.</p>

I. Liturgical Fragments, Early Saints' Plays and Parodies</h3>

<p>The earliest evidence of dramatic effort in England is to be found in Latin
tropes of the Easter service, composed for use in churches at different periods
between 967 and the middle of the eleventh century. While these are, of
course, serious in nature and function, they interest the historian of comedy
because they show that the dramatic spirit was at work among our ancestors
before the Anglo-Saxons had passed under the yoke of the Normans. Likewise
naturally devoid of comic interest, but of vital importance in the development
of a dramatic technique, are certain fragments of liturgical plays,
belonging to the library of Shrewsbury School, which were published in 1890
by Professor Skeat.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Each of these deals, as an integer, with a crisis in the
career of our Lord; and, except for occasional choruses and passages from
the liturgy in Latin, the plays are English&mdash;the English, in fact, translating
and enlarging upon the Latin of the service. Though the manuscript is probably
not older than 1400, it is a fragment, as Professor Manly has said, of a
series of plays of much earlier date, which were "performed in a church on
the days and in the service celebrating events of which the plays treat."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
These fragments are of great importance as constituting a link between the
dramatic tropes of the tenth and eleventh centuries and the scriptural pageants
presented at a later period outside the church: first by the clergy, with the
assistance, perhaps, of townspeople (as may have been the case when a Resurrection
play was given in the churchyard of St. John's, Beverley, about
1220); afterward by the civic authorities and the several gilds when church
plays had come to be acted commonly in the streets, that is, after the reinstitution
of the feast of Corpus Christi in 1311.</p>

<p>The existence of tropes at a period earlier than that in which mention is
made of plays based upon the miracles of the saints appears to me to negative
Professor Ten Brink's conjecture that in the development of our sacred drama
legendary subjects preceded the biblical. Indeed, the fact that dramas on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>subjects both biblical and legendary, and of a technique even more highly
developed than that of the Shrewsbury, were, as early as 1160, produced for
liturgical functions in France, not only by Frenchmen, but by one Hilarius,
who was presumably an Englishman, favours the opinion that the earliest
saints' plays in England, also, were as frequently derived from scriptural as
from legendary sources. It is, moreover, likely that the first saints' plays on
legendary subjects in England of which we have record were neither the first
of their kind in the period attributed to their presentation, nor a notable advance
in dramatic art when they were presented. There is nothing in the earliest
record of a legendary saint's play, the miracle of St. Katharine, presented by
Geoffrey, afterwards Abbot of St. Albans, at Dunstable about 1100, to warrant
the inference that it was a novelty, even at that date. Since Geoffrey
was at the time awaiting a position as schoolmaster, he was probably within
his function, <i>de consuetudine magistrorum et scholarum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when he produced
the play; and it is to be noticed that when Matthew of Paris writes concerning
the matter, about 1240, he appears to be much more interested in
an accident which attended the performance than in the mere composition and
presentation of what he calls "some play or other of St. Katharine, of the kind
that we <i>commonly</i> call Miracles."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Indeed, William Fitzstephen, writing
some seventy years before Matthew, speaks of such plays of the saints as in
his time quite customary. The probabilities are, then, that this first legendary
saint's play recorded as acted in England had been preceded by others of its
kind, and they in turn by miracles of biblical heroes and by liturgical plays and
dramatic tropes of the services of the church.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable to surmise that this legendary kind of miracle,
although sometimes used as part of the church service on the saint's day,
and originally possessed of serious features, speedily developed characteristics
helpful in the progress of the comic drama. All we know of the St. Katharine
play is that it was written for secular presentation at a date when no
mention is yet made of the public acting of scriptural plays. The dramatist
would, however, be more likely to adorn the useful with the amusing in the
preparation of a play not necessarily to be performed within the sacred precincts;
and while the technique of the legendary miracle was presumably
akin from the first to that of the biblical, it is natural to suppose that the plot
was handled with larger imaginative freedom.</p>

<p>But our knowledge of these early saints' plays need not be entirely a
matter of surmise. We may form a fair idea of their character from contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
testimony, from the style of the Latin or French saints' plays of
the time that have survived, from the nature of the legends dramatized, and
from the analogy of contemporary biblical plays. To the <i>locus classicus</i> of
contemporary testimony in William Fitzstephen's <i>Life of Thomas à Becket</i>
(1170-82) I have already made reference. Speaking of the theatrical shows
and spectacular plays of Rome, the biographer says that "London has plays
of a more sacred character&mdash;representations of the miracles which saintly
confessors have wrought, or of the sufferings whereby the fortitude of martyrs
has been displayed." According to this, the <i>ludi sanctiores</i>, or marvels, as
they seem later to be called,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> are of two classes:
the marvel of the faith
that removes mountains, the marvel of the fortitude that endures martyrdom.
In either case the saint's play is of the stuff that produces comedy; for,
whether the miracles are active or passive, the Christian saint and soldier
always proceeds victorious, and with increasing merit abides as ensample and
intercessor in the church invisible.</p>

<p>This relation of the saint's play to comedy appears the more evident
when we read in the <i>Golden Legend</i> and elsewhere the histories of the saints
who became favourites in English or foreign drama or pageant,&mdash;St. Katharine,
St. George, St. Susanna, St. Botulf, and the like. In most cases the triumph
of the marvel naturally outweighed the terror; and in the one of the few
English plays of the purely legendary kind that survives, the <i>St. George</i>&mdash;degenerate
in form and now merely a folk drama&mdash;the self-glorification of
the saint and the amusing discomfiture and recovery of himself and his foes are
the only elements that have outlived the stress of centuries. <i>The Miracle of
St. Nicholas</i>, written in the middle of the twelfth century, affords still better
opportunity of studying the dramatic quality of the kind in question. For the
author, Hilarius, wrote also in a like mixture&mdash;Latin with French refrains&mdash;a
scriptural play of Lazarus; and in collaboration with others, but entirely in
Latin, a magnificent dramatic history called <i>Daniel</i>. These, like the <i>St.
Nicholas</i>, were adapted to performance in church at the appropriate season in
the holy year, and no better illustration can be found of the essential difference
between the scriptural or so-called 'mystery' play, on the one hand, and the
saint's play, on the other, than is offered by them. The two scriptural plays,
stately, reverent, adapted to the solemn and regular ritual of which they are an
illustration in the concrete betray not a gleam of humour; the play of the other
kind, written as it is for the festival of a jovial saint, leaps <i>in medias res</i> with
bustle and surprise; and from the speech with which Barbarus entrusts his
treasure to the saint even to the last French refrain, after Nicholas has forced the
robbers to restitution, we are well over the brink of the comic. By the concluding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
scene, serious and in Latin of the church, setting forth the conversion
of the pagan, the feelings of the congregation are restored to the level of the
divine service, momentarily interrupted by the comedy but now resumed.</p>

<p>These, and all saints' plays not, like the St. Anne's play, of a cyclic
character, were, from the first, dramatic units; they represented a single
general plot, generally of a single hero; the action was focussed on the
critical period of his life; and a considerable incitement was consequently
offered to invention of incident and development of character. A comparative
study of the plays concerning St. Nicholas will justify the statement
that the dramatist was by way of taking liberties with, or varying, his selection
from legend. The Einsiedeln Nicholas play of the twelfth century
deals with a different miracle from that dramatized by Hilarius; and of the
four Fleury plays of St. Nicholas, probably composed in the same century,
the two that deal with these miracles vary the treatment; the other two are
on different themes, but all would appear, from the editions which we have
of them, to be promising little comedies. The possibilities of this kind of
drama are best displayed in still another play of St. Nicholas, written in
the vernacular by a Frenchman of Arras, Jean Bodel, about the year 1205.
Throwing the traditional legends entirely overboard, he gives his imagination
free course with favouring winds of knightly adventure, but over the waters
of everyday life. He produces a play at once comic, fanciful, and realistic,
the first of its kind&mdash;of so excellent a quality that Creizenach says that it
would appear as if dramatic poetry were even then well on the way of
development from the ecclesiastical model to a romantic kind of art in the
style of the later English and Spanish drama: chivalric, fantastic, and realistic.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, other plays of this kind, like the <i>Theophilus</i> of Rutebeuf,
do not always avail themselves of their chances; but we may in general surmise
that such plays in English&mdash;and we have evidence of many&mdash;contributed
as much as the biblical miracle to the cultivation of a popular taste for
comedy and the encouragement of inventive power in the handling of dramatic
fable. I believe that they contributed more than the pre-Reformation morals,
and from an earlier period.</p>

<p>I have said that in all probability there was nothing unusual in the presentation
of saints' plays by Hilarius and Geoffrey. Latin plays were not a
novelty in the twelfth century, at any rate to men of culture and the church.
When we consider the history of the Terentian and Plautine manuscripts,
how carefully the former were cherished, and with what appreciation a portion
at least of the latter, during the Middle Ages, we cannot but apprehend
the extent of their influence, even when unapparent, upon taste, style, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>thought. Plautus (in whose comedies, with those of Terence, St. Jerome was
wont to seek consolation after seasons of strenuous fasting and prayer) was
imitated in a <i>Querolus</i> and probably a <i>Geta</i>, as early as the fourth century; and
Terence was adapted by Hrosvitha in the tenth. We are, therefore, not at all
surprised when we find Latin comedy during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
clothing itself through France and Italy in the verdure of another spring.
To be sure the new style of production&mdash;a declamation by way of dialogue
or conversational narrative, in elegiac verse&mdash;was not intended for histrionic
presentation; but it was nevertheless of the dramatic <i>genus</i>; little by little the
narrative outline dwindled and the mimetic opportunities of the speaker were
emphasized. His success was measured by his skill in representing diverse
characters merely by changes of voice, countenance, and gesture. He is the
impersonator in transition to the actor. These elegiac comedies indicate the
continuing influence of Latin comedy upon the literary creativity of the day;
they furnish, besides, both the material for the regular drama that was coming,
and the taste by which it should be controlled. I am, indeed, of the opinion
that from this source the farce interludes of England, France, and Italy drew
much of their content during the next three centuries, and that the saint's
plays of that period, at least those in Latin, derived therefrom their dramatic
technique. The revival of Latin comedy during the twelfth century was
partly by way of adaptations, as in the dramatic poems of Vitalis of Blois;
partly of independent productions, fashioned upon classical models but dealing
with <i>contes</i>, <i>fabliaux</i> or <i>novelle</i> of contemporary quality. Of the latter kind
the more interesting examples upon the continent were the <i>Alda</i> of William of
Blois, and two elegiac poems, perhaps Italian, of lovers and go-betweens,&mdash;a
graceful and passionate comedy of <i>Pamphilus</i> and a dramatic version by one
Jacobus of the intrigue, so dear to mediæval satirists, between priest and
labourer's wife. The subject and treatment of the last of these suggest, at
once, a kinship with an <i>Interludium de Clerico et Puella</i> in English of the
end of the thirteenth century, and with an earlier English story from which
that is derived; also with Heywood's much later play of <i>Johan</i>. That there
was a Latin elegiac comedy in England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,&mdash;comedy
of domestic romance with all or some of the characters common
to the kind&mdash;youth and maid, wife and paramour, enamoured cleric,
faithless husband, cuckold, enraged father, parasite, slave, go-between, and
double,&mdash;is rendered probable by the survival of two such poems, one of
which bears internal evidence of its origin in England, while the only manuscripts
extant of the other were found in that country. The first lacks a
title, but has been called the <i>Baucis</i> after the manipulator of the intrigue, a
procuress; the second is named <i>Babio</i> for the unhappy hero who is at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
and the same time fooled by his wife whom he doesn't love, and his step-daughter
whom he does. Both comedies display the influence of classical
Latin, but the latter sparkles with the humour and spontaneity of the comedy
of contemporary life.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
</p>

<p>I agree, therefore, with Dr. Ward that the burden of proof is with those
who assert that the Latin comedy of the Middle Ages made no impression upon
the earlier drama of England. That the former was one of the tributaries of
the farce interlude and the principal source of the romantic play of domestic
intrigue I have no doubt whatever. And, considering the influx of French
clerics and culture during the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, and
the French affiliations of Geoffrey of St. Albans and Hilarius, our earliest
recorded writers of saints' plays, not to speak of the latinity of our Maps,
Wirekers, and other scholars of Henry II.'s reign, and their familiarity with
the literature of the Continent, which was Latin,&mdash;it would be unreasonable
to assume that the authors of our saints' plays, whether in Latin or not,
did not derive something of their technique from the elegiac comedies of their
contemporary latinists in France and England, or indeed from the adaptations
of Plautus and Terence in previous centuries, or from the originals themselves.</p>

<p>When the religious drama passed into the hands of the crafts, it carried
with it such individual plays, of both scriptural and legendary kinds, as were
suitable to the collective character which it was assuming. The Corpus Christi,
Whitsuntide, Easter, or Christmas cycle, though it aimed to illustrate sacred
history and so justify God's ways to man, drew its materials, not only from
the scriptures of the canon, but from the Apocrypha, the pseudo-Gospels, and
mediæval legends of scriptural and sometimes non-scriptural saints. There
was no real ground for distinction, and there is none now, dramatic or didactic,
between the non-scriptural stories of scriptural characters, St. Joseph,
and St. Thomas, stories of the Death, Assumption, and Coronation of the
Virgin, stories of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalene, which happened to be
absorbed into this or the other miracle cycle, and the non-scriptural stories
of extra-biblical saints in plays which have retained their independence: that
of Nicholas, for instance, or of Katharine or Laurence or Christina, except
that these and their heroes are concerned with events later than those which conclude
the earthly career of our Lord and of the Virgin Mary. All religious
historical plays, biblical or legendary, cyclic or independent, of events contemporaneous
with, or subsequent to, the scriptural, were miracles, properly so
called by our forefathers; and as the didactic intent of the species waned, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
was as likely as another to develop material for amusement. Indeed, the
authors of the <i>Manuel des Pechiez</i> and <i>The Handlynge Synne</i>,&mdash;the preacher
of that fourteenth-century attack upon miracle plays which has been preserved
in the <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>,&mdash;these, and Chaucer, Langland, and Wyclif make
no distinction between miracles of the central mystery from the Old and New
Testaments and miracles worked and suffered by saints, whether legendary or
biblical. The distinction, if any, made by them, is between miracles acted to
further belief by priests and clerks in orders in the church, and those acted for
amusement by these or by laymen in the streets and on the greens. And it is
safe to say that as soon as a play became more amusing than edifying, it fell
under the censure of the church. This happened as early as 1210, when a
decretal of Innocent III. forbade the acting of <i>ludi theatrales</i> in churches.
Indeed much earlier, for Tertullian and St. Augustine and the Councils had
consistently condemned the performances of <i>histriones</i>, <i>mimi</i>, <i>lusores</i>, and others
who perpetuated the traditions of the pagan Roman stage. In 1227 the
Council of Treves took such action. Gregory IX. attempted to put a stop
to the growing participation of the clergy, "lest the honour of the church
should be defiled by these shameful practices."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
And during the succeeding
decades more than one Synod issued orders of the same tenor. Now, even
though it is practically certain that these fulminations were directed against
perversions of divine worship, mock festivals and profane plays with the
monstrous disguisings or mummings involved,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
there is also no doubt that
the prohibition came speedily to apply to the use of masks and other disguises
in sacred plays, and then to the presentation of plays in church for
any other than devotional purposes. Such for instance was the <i>animus</i> with
which William of Wadington, in the <i>Manuel des Pechiez</i>, about 1235, called
attention to the scandal of the foolish clergy who, in disguise, acted miracles
'<i>ky est defendu en decré</i>.' To play the Resurrection in church, <i>pur plus
aver devociun</i>, was permissible; but to gather assemblies in the streets of the
cities after dinner, when fools more readily congregate, that was a sacrilege.
At this early date, we may be sure that the kind of drama which was
extruded from the church had already invested such of its subjects as were
biblical or legendary with the realistic and comic qualities which made for
popularity, and so was fitting itself for adoption by the crafts. Indeed, we
are told by a thirteenth-century historian of the Church of York,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that, at a
date which must be set near 1220, there was a representation <i>as usual</i> of the
Lord's Ascension by masked performers, in words and acting; and that a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
crowd of both sexes was assembled, led there by different impulses, <i>some by
mere pleasure and wonder</i>, others for a religious purpose. This was the play
in the churchyard of St. John's, Beverley, to which I have referred before.
The <i>miracula</i> of the story cited by Wright<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and conjecturally assigned to the
thirteenth century, had also passed beyond the sheer didactic stage, for the
auditors, who resorted to the spectacle in the "meadow above the stream,"
expressed their appreciation <i>nunc silentes nunc cachinnantes</i>. When, after the
reinstitution of the festival of Corpus Christi, in 1311, these plays began to
be a function of the gilds, their secularization, even though the clerks still participated
in the acting, was but a question of time; and the occasional injection
of crude comedy was a natural response to the civic demand. It would be
erroneous, however, to imagine that the church abandoned the drama when
the town took it up: the church maintained a liturgical drama, in some places,
until well into the sixteenth century; and as late as 1572 individual clergymen
are condemned for playing interludes in churches.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>If the writers of saints' plays, with their attempt to satisfy the yearning
for ideal freedom which is natural in all times and places, took, in their fictions
of the religious-marvellous, a step towards what may be called romantic
comedy,&mdash;a step no less important, though nowadays often unnoticed, was
taken toward the comedy of ridicule, satire, and burlesque, at a date quite as
remote, by the contrivers of religious parodies. It is curious, though not at
all unnatural, that some of the earliest efforts at comic entertainment should
proceed from the revolt against ecclesiastical formality and constraint. I
cannot in this place do more than remind the reader of the antiquity of three
of the most notable of these dramatic travesties: the Feast of Fools, the election
of the Boy Bishop, and the Feast of the Ass. The first of these was
celebrated on the Continent as early as 1182, one may say with reasonable
certainty, 990. It is indeed more than a conjecture that the Feasts of
Fools and the Ass inherited the license of the Roman Saturnalia, the season
and spirit of which were assimilated by the Christian Feast of the Nativity.
Whether adopted by the church in its effort to conciliate paganism, or tolerated
for reasons of secular policy, these mock-religious festivals were soon the
Frankenstein of Christianity; and it was doubtless against them rather than
the seductions of the sacred drama that most of the ecclesiastical prohibitions
of the Middle Ages were aimed. With its necessary comic accessories, the
Feast of Fools was well established in England before 1226, and it was still
flourishing in 1390 when Courtney forbade its performance in London.
"The vicars," he said, "and clerks dressed like laymen, laughed, shouted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>and acted plays which they commonly and fitly called the Feast of Fools."
They travestied the dignitaries of the church, they turned the service inside
out, put obscenity for sanctity and blasphemy for prayer. While it does not
appear that in England, as on the Continent,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the procession of the Boy Bishop
was attended with frivolity or profanity, it was certainly celebrated with mummings
and plays of suitable kind, not altogether serious. This ceremony dates
as far back as St. Nicholas day, 1229, and was still to the fore in 1556.
The Feast of the Ass appears to have been recognized by the church as early
as the Feast of Fools. I do not know when it was introduced into England,
but it was played upon Palm Sunday as late as the middle of the sixteenth
century. In France it had been notoriously wanton since the beginning of
the thirteenth; and it could not exist anywhere without promoting the spirit
of burlesque and farce. Although the initial purpose of these festivals was to
satirize the hierarchy and ecclesiastical convention, they applied themselves
after they had been repudiated by the church to the ridicule of social folly in
general; and, according to the descriptions of Warton, Douce, Hone, Klein,
Petit de Julleville, and others, they came to be a vivid interpreter of the
popular consciousness, a most potent educator of critical insight and dramatic
instinct, an incitement to artistic even though naïve productivity. In France,
indeed, the Fraternities of Fools produced national satirists and dramatic professionals
in one. In England, if they did nothing else, they helped to stimulate
a taste for realistic and satiric drama.</p>

<h3>2. The Miracle Cycles in their Relation to Comedy</h3>

<p>Miracle plays and 'marvels,' morals too as we soon shall see, were a propædeutic
to comedy rather than tragedy. For the theme of these dramas is,
in a word, Christian: the career of the individual as an integral part of the
social organism, of the religious whole. So also, their aim: the welfare of
the social individual. They do not exist for the purpose of portraying
immoderate self-assertion and the vengeance that rides after, but rather the
beauty of holiness or the comfort of contrition. Herod, Judas, and Antichrist
are foils, not heroes. The hero of the miracle seals his salvation by accepting
the spiritual ideal of the community. These plays contribute in a positive
manner to the maintenance of the social organism. The tragedies of life and
literature, on the other hand, proceed from secular histories, histories of personages
liable to disaster because of excessive peculiarity,&mdash;of person or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
position. Whether the rank of the tragic hero be elevated or mean, he is
unique: his desire is overweening, his frailty irremediable, or his passion unrestrained,&mdash;his
peril unavoidable; and in his ruin not the principal only, but
seconds and bystanders, are involved. Tragedy, then, is the drama of Cain,
of the individual in opposition to the social, political, divine; its occasion is an
upheaval of the social organism.</p>

<p>While the dramatic tone of the miracle cycle is determined by the conservative
character of Christianity in general, the nature of the several plays is
modified by the relation of each to one or other of the supreme crises in the
career of our Lord. The plays leading up to, and revolving about, the
Nativity, are of happy ending, and were doubtless regarded, by authors and
spectators, as we regard comedy. The murder of Abel, at first sombre,
gradually passes into the comedy of the grotesque. The massacre of the innocents
emphasizes, not the weeping of a Rachel, but the joyous escape of the
Virgin and the Child. In all such stories the horrible is kept in the background
or used by way of suspense before the happy outcome, or frequently
as material for mirth. Upon the sweet and joyous character of the pageants
of Joseph and Mary and the Child it is unnecessary to dwell. They are of
the very essence of comedy. The plays surrounding the Crucifixion and
Resurrection are, on the other hand, specimens of the serious drama, the
tragedy averted. It would hardly be correct to say tragedy; for the drama
of the cross is a triumph. In no cycle does the <i>consummatum est</i> close the
pageant of the Crucifixion; the actors announce, and the spectators believe,
that this is "goddis Sone," whom within three days they shall again behold,
though he has been "nayled on a tree unworthilye to die." By this consideration,
without doubt, the horror of the buffeting and the scourging, the
solemnity of the passion, the inhuman cruelty&mdash;but not the awe&mdash;of the
Crucifixion, were mitigated for the spectators. Otherwise, mediæval as they
were, they could have taken but little pleasure in the realism with which their
fellows presented the history of the Sacrifice.</p>

<p>To indulge in a comprehensive discussion of the beginnings of comedy in
England would be pleasant, but I find that I cannot compel the materials into
the limits at my command. Accordingly, since the miracle cycles (to which
Dodsley, following the French, gave the convenient, but un-English and somewhat
misleading, name of 'mysteries') have been more frequently and generously
treated by historians than those other miracles, non-scriptural, which I
would call 'marvels,' and the no less important popular festival plays and
early farces, and 'morals' or moral and 'mery' interludes, it seems that, in
favour of the latter, I should defer much that might be said about the cycles
until a more spacious occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>

The manuscript of the York plays appears to have been made about 1430-40;
that of the Wakefield, or so-called Towneley, toward the end of the same
century; the larger part of the N-town, or so-called Coventry, in 1468; and
the manuscripts of the Chester between 1591 and 1607. The last are,
however, based upon a text of the beginning of the fifteenth or the end of
the fourteenth century; and there is good reason to believe that some of the
plays were in existence during the first half of the fourteenth. A tradition,
suspicious but not yet wholly discredited, assigns their composition to the
period 1267-76. The York cycle, according to Miss Lucy Toulmin
Smith, was composed between 1340 and 1350. As to the Towneley
plays, Mr. Pollard decides that they were built in at least three distinct
stages, covering a period of which the limits were perhaps 1360 and 1410.
While the composition of the so-called Coventry (apparently acted by strolling
players) may in general be assigned to the first half of the fifteenth century,
some parts give evidence of earlier date. The authenticated dates of the
representation of miracles in Coventry, 1392-1591, I prefer to attribute not
to this N-town cycle, but to the Coventry Gild plays, two of which still
exist.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
They possess no special importance for our present purpose. The
Newcastle Shipwrights' Play is the much battered survivor of a cycle that was
in existence in 1426. The Ms. of the three Digby plays of interest to us
is assigned by Dr. Furnivall to the latter half of the fifteenth century. The
subject of the first of them, the <i>Killing of the Children</i>, is of early dramatic
use, and the treatment of the poltroon knight corresponds suggestively with
Warton's account of the Christmas play given by the English bishops at the
Council of Constance in 1417. The two Norwich pageants which survive
are by no means naïve: they were touched up, if not written, during the
second third of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Other cycle plays which might be enumerated must be omitted, with the
exception of the Cornish. These were written in Cymric, apparently somewhat
before 1300. They are suggestive to the historian of comedy particularly
because they yield no faintest glimmer of a smile, save at their
exquisite credulity and unconsciousness of art. They are a noble instance of
the sustained seriousness of the scriptural cycle in its early, if not its original,
popular stage, and, also, of that familiar handling of the sacred that prepares
the way for the liberty of the comic.</p>

<p>In approaching the English miracle plays we notice that, as in the Cornish,
the earliest secular form of the older cycles was principally, if not entirely,
serious. Reasons which I cannot stay to enumerate prove that comic plays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
in the older cycles are not of the original series, and that humorous passages
in plays of the older series are of later interpolation. Now, so far as
the direct effect upon the comedy of Heywood, Greene, and Shakespeare is
concerned, it may appear to some of no particular importance in what order
the cycles in general were composed or the plays within the cycles. But the
Tudor dramatists did not make their art, they worked with what they found,
and they found a dramatic medium of expression to which centuries and
countless influences had contributed. An extended study of the beginnings
of English comedy should determine, so far as possible, the relative priority,
not only of cycles, but of the comic passages within the cycles: what each
composition has contributed to the enfranchisement of the comic spirit and
the development of the technical factors of the art; to what extent each has
expressed or modified the realistic, satirical, romantic, or humorous view of
life, and in what ways each has reflected the temper of its time, the manners
and the mind of the people that wrote, acted, and witnessed. If I arrange
the plays that bear upon the development of comedy according to my conclusions
regarding priority of composition, the order, broadly stated for our
present rapid survey, is as follows: first, the Cornish and the Old Testament
portions of the Chester and Coventry; then the productions of the second
and third periods of the York, and, closely following these, the crowning
efforts of the Towneley; then the New Testament plays of the Chester and
Coventry; and, finally, the surviving portions of the cycles of Digby and
Newcastle. This order, which is roughly historical, has the advantage, as I
perceive after testing it, of presenting a not unnatural sequence of the æsthetic
values or interests essential to comedy: first, as a full discussion would reveal,
the humour of the incidental; then of the essential or real, and, gradually, of
the satirical in something like their order of appearance within the cycles;
afterwards, the accession of the romantic, the wonderful, the allegorical, the
mock-ideal; and, finally, of the scenic and sensational.</p>

<p>Of the significant lack of humour in the Cornish plays I have already
spoken. I find, though I may not stay to illustrate, a livelier observation and
a superior faculty of characterization and construction in the early comic art of
Chester than in that of Coventry, but in both a cruder sense of the humour of
incident than in the other English cycles. In the York cycle there are fewer
situations that may be called purely comic than in the Chester, and none of
these occurs in the oldest plays of the series; but for its other contributions to
dramatic art and its relation to the remarkable productions of the Wakefield or
Towneley school of comedy it deserves special attention. A comparative
study of its versification, phraseology and dramatic technique, leads me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
the conclusion that the original didactic kernel of the York cycle was enlarged
and enriched during two well-defined periods, which may be termed
the middle and the later, and that there was at least one playwright in each of
these periods or schools who distinctly made for the development of English
comedy. Of the middle period, to which belong <i>Cain</i>, <i>Noah</i>, and the <i>Shepherds'
Plays</i>, the playwright or playwrights are characterized by an unsophisticated
humour; the distinctive playwright of the later or realistic period is
marked by his observation of life, his reproduction of manners, his dialogue,
and the plasticity of his technique. That the later school or period, to which
belongs a group of half a dozen plays<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> gathering
about <i>The Dream of Pilate's
Wife</i>, and <i>The Trial before Herod</i>, was, moreover, influenced by the manner
of its predecessor is indicated by the fact that of its two most efficient stanzaic
forms one, namely that used in <i>The Conspiracy</i>, is anticipated (though in simpler
iambic beat) by that of <i>Noah</i>, the typical play of the middle, that is the first
comic, school,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> while the other,
of which the variants are found in <i>The Mortificacio</i>
and <i>The Second Trial</i>, has its germ more probably in <i>The Cayme</i>
of that same school than in any other of the middle or of the earlier plays.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
With these two stanzaic forms the later group, so far as we may conclude
from the mutilated condition of the surviving plays, seems to experiment;
and the second of them, that of the <i>Mortificacio</i>, may be regarded as the final
and distinctive outcome of York versification. To the leading playwrights
of each of these schools,&mdash;the former the best humorist, the latter the best
realist, of the York drama,&mdash;to these anonymous composers of the most facile
and vivid portions of the York cycle our comedy owes a still further debt; for
from them it would appear that a poet of undoubted genius derived something
of his inspiration and much of his method and technique&mdash;our first great comic
dramatist, the Playwright of Wakefield.</p>

<p>We know that Wakefield actors sometimes played in the Corpus Christi
plays of York, and it was only natural that the smaller town should borrow
from the dramatic riches of its metropolitan neighbour. We are, therefore,
not surprised to find in the Wakefield cycle a number of plays which have
been taken bodily from the York cycle.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
None of these is in the distinctive
stanzaic form of which we have just spoken; but imbedded in certain other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
Wakefield plays<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
that in other respects show marks of derivation from earlier
and discarded portions of the York cycle, we find occasional affiliated forms of
the distinctive later York strophe evidently in a transitional period of its development.
We find, furthermore, passages in this transitional York strophe side
by side with Wakefield stanzas which display the strophe in a more highly
artistic technique than anything found in the York.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The writer of the perfected
York-Wakefield stanza, such as appears in the Towneley plays, must
have, consciously or unconsciously, been influenced by the middle and later
York schools of dramatic composition. This fully developed outcome of the
distinctive York stanza of the later school is found in the guise of a nine-line
stanza in certain Towneley plays which we see reason for attributing to a
Wakefield genius, and which we shall presently consider. Suffice it in this
place to say that of the Wakefield stanza the first four lines, when resolved,
according to their internal rhymes, into separate verses, run thus: abababab².
If to this we add the <i>cauda</i>, our stanza runs abababab²c¹ddd²c². Sometimes,
indeed, a three-accented line occurs among the first eight, showing the
more plainly that this thirteen-line stanza of Wakefield (though set down in
nine lines) is a variant or derivative of the thirteen-line York XXXVI.,&mdash;ababbcbc³d¹eee²d³.
And that in itself is, as I have already said, a
refinement upon the fourteen-line stanza of the earlier comic school of York,
as used in the <i>Noah</i>. Whether the rapid beat and frequently recurring rhyme
of the Wakefield are a conscious elaboration of the York or a happy find or
accident, the stanzaic result is an accurate index to the superiority in spirit
and style achieved over their congeners of York by these comedies of Wakefield.</p>

<p>Now, the contiguity of what is undoubtedly borrowed from the York
with what is imitated from it and what is elaborated upon it, is strong proof
of a conscious relation between these Wakefield productions and those of York;
and since the work of the poet, especially the provincial poet, was in those
days (though verse forms, like air, are free to all) likely to be cast in a fixed
mould&mdash;his favourite metrical and strophaic medium, there is at any rate a
possibility that the plays and portions of plays in the Wakefield cycle, written
in this fully developed and distinctive stanza, were the work of one man.
When we examine the contents of the plays and their style, we find that
the possibility becomes more than a probability, practically a certainty; and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
being so, I can hardly deem it an accident that the most dramatic portions of
the Wakefield cycle show so close an external resemblance to the best comic
and realistic portions of the York. It is, then, with something of the interest
in an individual, not a theory, that one may segregate the plays and bits of
plays bearing this metrical stamp, look for the personality behind them, and
attempt to discover the relation of the Wakefield group of comedies to its forerunners
of York.</p>

<p>The Wakefield cycle is still in flux when its distinctive poet-humorist
takes it in hand. Insertions in his nine-line stanza are found in one<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of
the five plays derived from the York cycle. Of the two plays which show
a general resemblance to a corresponding York, one<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> is in this stanza,
and to the other<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a dozen of the stanzas are prefixed. The <i>Fflagellacio</i>
(XXII.), the second half of which is an imitation, sometimes loose, sometimes
literal, of York XXXIV. (<i>Christ Led up to Calvary</i>), opens with
twenty-three of these stanzas,&mdash;nearly the whole of the original part. One
of them, No. 25, is, by the way, based upon stanza 2 of that part of
York XXXIV. which is <i>not</i> taken over by the Wakefield play. In the Wakefield
<i>Ascension</i> (XXIX.), which adapts, but in no slavish manner, a few passages
from the York (XLIII.), we find two of this playwright's nine-line
stanzas;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and in the Wakefield <i>Crucifixion</i> (XXIII.), which has some slight
reminiscence of York XXXV. and XXXVI., we find one. In that part of the
Wakefield less directly, or not at all, connected with the York cycle, four
whole plays,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
the <i>Processus Noe</i>, the two <i>Shepherds' Plays</i>, and the <i>Buffeting</i>,
and occasional portions of other plays<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
are written in this stanza. This contribution
in the nine-line stanza amounts to approximately one-fourth of the
cycle; and, allowing for modifications due to oral and scribal transmission, is
of one language and phraseology. Not merely the identity of stanza and
diction, however, leads one to suspect an identity of authorship; but the
prevalence in all these passages, and not in others, of spiritual characteristics
in approximately the same combination,&mdash;realistic and humorous qualities
singularly suitable to the development of a vigorous national comedy. "If
any one," says Mr. Pollard, "will read these plays together, I think he cannot
fail to feel that they are all the work of the same writer, and that this
writer deserves to be ranked&mdash;if only we knew his name!&mdash;at least as high
as Langland, and as an exponent of a rather boisterous kind of humour had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
no equal in his own day." And, speaking of the <i>Mactacio Abel</i>, where we
lack the evidence of identity of metre, this authority continues, "The extraordinary
youthfulness of the play and the character of its humour make it difficult
to dissociate it from the work of the author of the <i>Shepherds' Plays</i>, and
I cannot doubt that this, also, at least in part, must be added to his credit."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>To this conclusion I had come before reading Mr. Pollard's significant
introduction to the <i>Towneley Plays</i>; and I may say that I had suspected the
Wakefield master in the <i>Processus Talentorum</i> as well; for though, with the
exception of some insertions, the stanzaic form of that pageant is not his
favourite, the humour, dramatic method, and phraseology of the whole are
distinctly reminiscent of him. In the revising and editing of the Wakefield
cycle as he found it this playwright was brought into touch with the York
schools of comic and realistic composition. What he derived from them
and what he added may be gathered from a comparative view of the related
portions of these cycles. That, however, I must defer until another time.
The best of his plays are of course the <i>Noe</i> and the <i>Secunda Pastorum</i>;
the latter a product of dramatic genius. It stands out English and alone,
with its homespun philosophy and indigenous figures,&mdash;Mak and Gyll and
the Shepherds,&mdash;its comic business, its glow, its sometimes subtle irony,
its ludicrous colloquies, its rural life and manners, its naïve and wholesome
reverence: with these qualities it stands apart from other plays of cycles foreign
or native, and in its dramatic anticipations, postponements, and surprises
is our earliest masterpiece of comic drama. A similar dramatic excellence
characterizes all this poet's plays, as well as the insertions made by him in other
plays. But he is no more remarkable for his dramatic power than for his sensitive
observation and his satire.</p>

<p>Of the realism of his art much might be said. To be sure, we cannot
accredit to him the grim photography of certain plays&mdash;the preparations for
the crucifixion, for instance, which are the counterpart of scenes in the York.
But the <i>Buffeting</i> proves his power in this direction, and parts of the <i>Scourging</i>&mdash;each
a <i>genre</i> picture on a background of horrors. Of conversations
caught from the lip those in the second and fourth scenes of the <i>Processus
Noe</i> are his, and those between the shepherds in <i>Prima</i> and <i>Secunda Pastorum</i>,&mdash;all
of them unique. So also the description of the dinners in these <i>Shepherds'
Plays</i>: the boar's brawn, cow's foot, sow's shank, blood puddings,
ox-tail, swine's jaw, the good pie, "all a hare but the loins," goose's leg,
pork, partridge, tart for a lord, calf's liver "scored with the verjuice," and
good ale of Ely to wash things down. What more seasonable than the afterthought
of collecting the broken meats for the poor? what more naïve than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
night-spell in the name of the Crucified just preceding the angelic announcement
of his birth? what more typical of unquestioning faith than the reverence
of these "Sely Shepherds" before the Saviour Child, the simplicity
and acceptability of their rustic gifts? This is the fresh and sympathetic
handling of a well-worn theme. But the Wakefield poet is no sentimentalist:
his anger burns as sudden as his pity. Otherwhere genially ironical, it is in his
revision of the <i>Judicium</i> that he displays his full power as a satirist. Here
his hatred of oppression, his scorn of vice and self-love, his contempt of sharp
and shady practice in kirk or court, upon the bench, behind the counter, or
by the hearth are welded into one and brought to edge and point. He strikes
hard when he will, but he has the comic sense and spares to slay. We may
hear him chuckling, this Chaucerian "professor of holy pageantry," as he
pricks the bubble of fashion, lampoons Lollard and "kyrkchaterar" alike,
and parodies the latinity of his age. When his demons speak the syllables
leap in rhythmic haste, the rhymes beat a tattoo, and the stanzas hurtle by.
Manners, morals, folly, and loose living are writ large and pinned to the
caitiff. But the poet behind the satire is ever the same, sound in his domestic,
social, political philosophy, constant in his sympathy with the poor and in
godly fear.</p>

<p>Though there are comic scenes of some excellence in the later Chester
and so-called Coventry plays, they add little to the variety of the Wakefield.
I would, however, call attention to a few other comparatively modern, but,
generally speaking, contemporaneous, characteristics of these and the remaining
cycles: the foreshadowing of the chivalrous-romantic in the Joseph and Mary
plays of York, Wakefield, and especially Coventry; of the melodramatic in
the wonder and mediæval magic of the York and Chester cycles, and again
especially in the Coventry; of the allegorical in the Coventry, and of the
burlesque in all cycles when Pride rides for a fall or Cunning is caught in
his own snare.</p>

<p>In respect of the sensational, the older cycles are surpassed by the surviving
plays of Newcastle and Digby; so also in the increasing complexity of
motive and interest. These Digby plays were acted, probably one by one in
some midland village from year to year during the latter half of the fifteenth
century, and maybe somewhat earlier. They are of interest, not only because
they emphasize the sensational element, but because they stand half-way, if not
in time, at any rate in spirit and method, between the miracles that we have so
far discussed and the moral plays of which we shall presently treat. The Digby
<i>Killing of the Children of Israel</i> lends a decided impetus to the progress of
the comic and secular tendencies of the drama. The Herod brags as usual,
but he is artistically surpassed in his <i>metier</i> by a certain <i>miles gloriosus</i>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
descendant of Bumbommachides and Sir Launscler Depe, and himself the
forerunner of Thersites and Roister Doister, and countless aspirants for
knighthood, whose valour "begynnes to fayle and waxeth feynt" under
the distaff of an angry wife. Such is the Watkyn of this Digby play.
Both here and in the <i>Conversion of St. Paul</i>, the joyous element has been
enhanced, as Dr. Furnivall points out, by the introduction of dancing and
music. In the <i>Conversion</i> the charm supplied by the ammoniac Billingsgate
of Saul's servant and the ostler adds thrills galore. Saul, "goodly besene
in the best wyse, like an aunterous knyth," the thunder and lightning, the
persecutor felled to earth, "godhed speking from hevyn," the Holy Ghost,
the "dyvel with thunder and fyre" sitting cool upon a "chayre in hell,
another devyll with a fyeryng, cryeng and roryng,"&mdash;the warning angel,
Saul's escape,&mdash;there is sign enough of invention here. To be sure, these
seductions are counterbalanced by a didactic on the Seven Deadly Sins,
worthy of a preceding or contemporary moral drama; but that was part of
the bargain. The spectacular plays of this group, especially the <i>Mary Magdalene</i>,
comic and didactic by turns, denote a further advance in a still different
direction. They portray character in process of formation: the rejection
of former habits and motives, and the adoption of new, the resulting
change of conduct, and the growth of personality. From this point of
view Mary Magdalene is a figure of as rare distinction in the history of romantic
comedy as the Virgin Mary,&mdash;perhaps even of greater importance.
Interesting as the sensational elements of the play may have been, and novel&mdash;the
vital novelty here is that of character growing from within. Wonderful
as the career of the virgin mother was,&mdash;an essential propædeutic to that
woman worship which characterizes a broad realm of Christian romance,&mdash;her
career could never have awakened the peculiar interest, dramatic and
humane, that was stirred by the legend so often dramatized of the wayward,
tempted, falling, but finally redeemed and sainted Mary of Magdala.</p>

<p>With regard to the transitional character of the Digby plays, it has been
maintained that this particular play, combining materials of the biblical miracle
and the saint's play or marvel, approaches more nearly than any other of the
group to the morals and moral interludes, because of the prominence of the
Sensual Sins in the dramatic career of the Magdalene. Professor Cushman,
in his excellent thesis on <i>The Devil and the Vice</i>, even asserts that the downfall
of the heroine, as the result of sensual temptation which is the office of
seven personified deadly sins "arayyd lyke vij dylf," is a special 'development'
of this play. I can hardly go so far: the church of the Middle
Ages, Caxton's <i>Golden Legend</i> of 1483, and Voragine's of 1270-90 had
already amalgamated the biblical narratives of the Mary of seven devils, Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
of Bethany, and the woman who was a sinner. In fact, the suggestion of
the 'device,' if such was necessary, is contained in seven consecutive lines
of Caxton's <i>Life of the Magdalene</i>. This biblical and legendary play is,
however, undoubtedly well on the way toward the drama of the conflict
of good and evil for possession of the human soul. And this appears, as the
author just cited has pointed out, when we consider a later work on the same
subject, called a Moral Interlude, by Lewis Wager. Although the Seven
Deadly Sins no longer figure as such, their place is here supplied by four
characters,&mdash;Infidelitie the Vice, and his associates, Pride of Life, Cupiditie,
and Carnal Concupiscence,&mdash;who, arrayed like gallants, instruct the Magdalene
in their several follies, and are themselves all "children of Sathan."
These later Vices are nothing other than selected Deadly Sins,&mdash;the Pride,
the Covetyse, and the Lechery of the earlier miracle play.</p>

<h3>3. The Dramatic Value of the English Miracle Plays</h3>

<p>Taken as a whole, the craft cycle possesses the significance, continuity,
and finality requisite to dramatic art; taken in its parts or pageants, however,
it presents to the modern reader the appearance of a mosaic, an historical
panel picture, or stereopticon show. I set down these words, "the
modern reader," because I do not believe that the audience of contemporaries
was aware of any break in the sequence of the collective spectacle. This
histrionic presentment of the biblical narrative lacked neither motive nor
method to the generations of the ages of belief. For them the history of the
world was thus unrolled in episodes the opposite of disconnected,&mdash;each a
hint or sign or sample, a type or antitype of the scheme of salvation, which
was itself import and impulse of all history. No serious scene, but was
confirmation or prophecy. Characters, institutions, and events of the Old-Testament
drama had their <i>raison d'être</i> not only in themselves but in the
New Testament antitype which each in turn prefigured. No profound theological
training was needed to comprehend each symbol and its significance, to
esteem all as centring in the Person of history, in the sacrifice and atonement.
And still it is largely because historians have failed to appreciate the scriptural
training of our ancestors that they have unfairly emphasized the episodic nature
of the miracle cycles, at any rate of the English.</p>

<p>The integral quality of the English cycle is infinitely superior to that
of the French; and the separate plays are more frequently artistic units.
This is due, among other things, to facts long ago pointed out by Ebert.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
The smaller stage in England, which in turn restricted the scope of the play,
made it impossible to split up the action into two or more parallel movements,
such as frequently occupied the stage in France. The scene, moreover, was
in England limited to earth, save when the plot expressly required the presentation
of heaven or hell. It very rarely required all three at once. The
conduct of the English play is therefore less dependent upon the supernatural,
and the persons bear a closer resemblance to actual human beings. Neither
plot nor character is distracted by the irresponsible intrusion of devils, whereas
these, idling about the French stage, frequently turned the action into horse-play,&mdash;if
the fool (likewise absent from the English miracle) had not already turned
it into a farce out of all relation to the fable. The comic element in the English
play had to exist by virtue of its relation to the main action or not at all.
It was therefore compelled to conquer its position within the artistic bounds of
the drama. The comic scenes of the English miracle should accordingly be
regarded, not as interruptions, nor independent episodes, but as harmonious
counterpoint or dramatic relief. Those who have witnessed in recent times
the reproduction of the <i>Secunda Pastorum</i> at one of the American universities
bear testimony to the propriety and charm, as well as the dramatic effect,
with which the foreground of the sheep-stealing fades into the radiant picture
of the nativity. The pastoral atmosphere is already shot with a prophetic
gleam, the fulfilment is, therefore, no shock or contrast, but a transfiguration&mdash;an
epiphany. I do not forget that a less humorous analogue of the <i>Shepherds'
Play</i> exists in such French mysteries as that of the <i>Conception</i>, but I call
attention to the fact that by devices, technical sometimes, sometimes naïve,
elaborated through the centuries in response to the demands of a popular
æsthetic consciousness, the cycles, preëminently in England, acquired a delicacy
and variety of colour, an horizon, and an atmosphere, not only as wholes,
but in the parts contributing to the whole.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, only with reservation that I can concur with what one of
our most scientific and suggestive historians has said concerning the dramatic
qualities of the English miracle play:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
"In the mystery, not only were
the subject and the idea unalterable, but the way in which the subject and
idea affected each other was equally unchangeable. The power of expression
was exceedingly defective. The idea in the finished work still
seemed to be something strange and external&mdash;conception and execution
did not correspond. It is only by a whole cycle that the subject could
be exhausted, and this cycle was composed of the most heterogeneous elements,
and is, in fact, a work of accident. The cycle play very seldom
formed a unit or whole; it seldom contained anything that could be called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>
a dramatic action. The spectators were therefore interested only in the
matter. Only a few details made any æsthetic effect&mdash;such as character,
situation, scenes; the whole was rarely or never dramatic." I will grant
that, since the subject of the individual pageant was prescribed by tradition,
and the solution of the dramatic problem already fixed, the author did not always
penetrate the shell of his story and assimilate the conception. Consequently
the execution has frequently the faults of the ready-made suit of clothes: it
creases where it should fall free and breaks where it should embrace. As the
writer is not expected to exercise his invention, the onlooker estimates the
conduct of the fable as a spectacle, not as a revelation. Many of the miracles,
therefore, lack the element of dramatic surprise, and almost none attempts
anything in the way of character development. This is, in part, because,
severally, the plays are squares of an historical chessboard, upon which the
individual&mdash;king or pawn&mdash;is merely a piece; and even if the board be not
historic, the squares are over strait for the gradual deploy of motive; many of
these plays are scenes, consequently, and limited to single crises of an individual
life. In other words, the character, if familiar, is regarded as an instrument
toward a well-known end; if unfamiliar, as an apparition momentarily
vivid. Slight opportunity exists for interplay of incident and character, for
the production of conduct, in short, which is the resultant of character and a
crisis. It must also be conceded that, since each play was the dear delight
of its proprietary gild&mdash;and each rare performance thereof the chance that
should grace these craftsmen ever or disgrace them quite&mdash;the effort of actor,
if not always of playwright, was towards a speedy and startling effect, such as
might be procured by the extraneous quality of the show, rather than by the
story in itself or in its relation to the cycle.</p>

<p>But still we must be careful not to generalize from a play here and there
to the quality of a cycle as a whole or to the common qualities of various cycles.
When we say that the mysteries, that is, the scriptural miracles, possessed
this, that, or the other merit or defect, to what area and what object does the
remark apply? Do we refer to all the extant plays, or only to the one hundred
and fifty plays in the five cycles that may be called complete? Do we
draw the inference from a majority of all plays that might fall within the purview,
or from the plays of one cycle, or from a majority of the plays in that
cycle, or from a single striking example here or there in one or another cycle
or fragmentary collection? Do we draw the inference from, or apply the
conclusion indiscriminately to, later as well as earlier cycles and plays? A
generalization from the Chester does not <i>prima facie</i> fit the Towneley, nor
does a dramatic estimate of the Coventry characterize the isolated miracle
morals of the Digby. Between the composition of the earliest and the latest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
of the Chester plays alone, centuries elapsed; centuries between the earliest
Coventry and the earliest Digby; generations between Chester and Coventry
plays upon the same subject, and generations more between the York and
Newcastle. York includes some of the youngest pageants of the species and
many of the oldest. Towneley is generally later than York; but it sometimes
retains an original which York had long ago discarded for something
more modern. Returning, therefore, to Professor ten Brink's generalization,
we must submit that most of the defects which he lays at the door of the
cyclic miracle were not inherent in the species, but incidental to the period.
Some attach to the crudeness of the playwright, some to the simplicity of the
audience; they no doubt attached to the collective "morals" of the fourteenth
century, such as the <i>Paternoster Play</i>, and they would have characterized
plays of any other species attempted under like conditions. The best miracle
plays are as mature products of dramatic art as the best of the allegorical kind,
except in one point only&mdash;the development of character. That "the subject
and its idea should be unalterable" and their interrelation fixed, is by no
means a peculiarity of the scriptural play, but a characteristic of period or
place. If the reader will cast even a rapid glance by way of comparison
over the French <i>Corpus</i> of mysteries and the English, he will observe that the
scope of subjects possible to a religious cycle was amenable to widely different
conditions of restriction, selection, and enlargement, and that the treatment of
the same and similar subjects was infinitely varied. To illustrate at length
would be a work of supererogation. Everybody knows that the French cycles
have plays upon subjects, the Job, for instance, and Tobias and Esther,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> not
touched by the English,&mdash;at any rate when in their prime; and that the
same subject or episode is frequently treated in a way dissimilar to the English.
When we turn to details we note likewise the independence of the
playwright: none of the English plays avails itself, for instance, of Adam's
difficulty in swallowing the apple, though the incident figures both in
<i>Le Mistere de la Nativite</i> and that of the <i>Viel Testament</i>; nor of the attractive
possibilities of Reuben and Rachel's maid, Joseph and Potiphar's wife,
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and many another conjunction known to
all readers of the French religious play. And these discrepancies between
national cycles hold true even where, as in the case of the Chester plays,
the influence of the French mysteries of the thirteenth century and of the
later collections is in other respects evident. Of the four English cycles,
moreover, each does not select exactly the same subjects for its pageants as
the others,&mdash;Balaam and his Ass, for instance, appear only in the Chester,&mdash;nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>
do all introduce the same incidents in the handling of a common
subject.</p>

<p>Professor ten Brink is by no means alone in his estimate of the technical
quality of the English scriptural miracle, but I must say that the estimate
seems to me to be hardly up to the deserts of the species. The frequent
absence of such refinements as the unities of time and place was of the essence
both of play and period; but it was not of the essence of the miracle cycle
that the expression should be defective, or that conception and execution
should fail to correspond, or of the miracle play that it should be unable economically
and adequately to develop a dramatic action and produce an artistic
whole. It may be an insufficient argument to say that the plays of the
Wakefield dramatist are anything but defective in expression. Let us, therefore,
be somewhat more comprehensive in the scope of inquiry. I have gone
carefully through the four English cycles with Professor ten Brink's censures
in mind, and I conclude that at least twenty of the individual plays have central
motive, consistent action, and well-rounded dramatic plot. Indeed I
think a good case might be made for thirty. That would be to say that one-fifth
of the miracles of the great cycles were artistic units in themselves, and
must have interested their spectators, not alone by the materials displayed, but
by a subject that meant something, and situations, scenes, and acting characters
by which it was sometimes not at all unworthily presented. The
inheritors of English literature will indeed carry away a false impression of
the artistic achievements of their ancestors, if they believe that in spite of a
development of five hundred years the miracle play was "rarely or never
dramatic."</p>

<p>Even though the sacred and traditional character of the biblical narrative
must have exercised a restraint upon the comic tendencies of the cyclic poet
not likely to have existed in the case of the writers of saints' plays and single
morals, still it is when he attempts the comic that the cyclic poet is most
independent. For as soon as plays have passed into the hands of the gilds,
the playwright puts himself most readily into sympathy with the literary consciousness
as well as the untutored æsthetic taste of his public when he colours
the spectacle, old or new, with what is preëminently popular and distinctively
national. In the minster and out of it, all through the Christian year, the townsfolk
of York and Chester had as much of ritual, of scriptural narrative, and tragic
mystery as they wanted, and probably more; when the pageants were acted,
they listened with simple credulity, no doubt, to the sacred history, and with a
reverence that our age of illumination can neither emulate nor understand;&mdash;but
with keenest expectation they awaited the invented episodes where tradition
conformed itself to familiar life,&mdash;the impromptu sallies, the cloth-yard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>
shafts of civic and domestic satire sped by well-known wags of town or
gild. Of the appropriateness of these insertions, spectators made no question,
and the dramatists themselves do not seem to have thought it necessary to
apologize for æsthetic creed or practice. The objections thereto proceeded
from the authorities of the church, but the very tenor and tone of them are a
testimony to the importance attained by the comic element in the religious
plays. It is principally the "bourdynge and japynge" which attended the
"pleyinge of Goddis myraclys and werkes," that called forth the wrath of
the sermon that I have already cited from the end of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
And it was for similar reasons that Bishop Wedego ordered, in 1471, the
suppression of both passion play and saints' plays within his continental diocese.
In France, indeed, not only horse-play characterized the performance
of the mysteries, but absolutely irrelevant farces invaded them, merely <i>afin que
le jeu soit moins fade et plus plaisans</i>.</p>

<p>I have alluded to the distinctively national note that characterizes the comic
contributions to the sacred plays, and I find that my opinion is confirmed by
the examples cited by Klein and Creizenach. The French mystery poets,
while they develop, like the English, the comic quality of the shepherd scenes,
introduce the drinking and dicing element <i>ad lib.</i>,&mdash;and sometimes the
drabbing; they make, moreover, a specialty of the humour of deformity, a
characteristic which appears nowhere in the English plays. The Germans,
in their turn, elaborate a humour peculiar to themselves,&mdash;elephantine, primitive,
and personal. They seem to get most run out of reviling the idiosyncrasies
of Jews, whose dress, appearance, manners, and speech they caricature,&mdash;even
introducing Jewish <i>dramatis personæ</i> to sing gibberish, exploit cunning,
and perform obscenities under the names of contemporary citizens of the
hated race. In general a freer rein seems to have been given to the sacrilegious,
grotesque, and obscene on the Continent than in England. In the <i>Passion</i>
of A. Greban (before 1452), Herod orders Jesus into the garb of a
fool; and in some of the German plays the judges dance about the cross upon
which the Saviour hangs. Much of the ribaldry was of course impromptu,
and on that account the more grotesque; as in the story related by Bebel of
how a baker playing the part of Christ in the <i>Processus Crucis</i> bore the gibes
of his tormentors with admirable composure, until one actor Jew insisted
upon calling him a corn thief,&mdash;"Shut up," retorted the Christ, "or
I'll come down and break your head with the cross." There is, of course,
an occasional license in the English plays, such as the dance about the cross
in the Coventry; but the excess of ribaldry, <i>grotesquerie</i>, and <i>diablerie</i> does
not assault the imagination as in the continental mysteries.</p>

<h3>4. The Contribution of Later "Marvels" and Early Secular Plays</h3>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
The advance which remained to be made upon the quality of play presented
in the miracle cycle before England could have an artistic comedy were
threefold: <i>first</i>, from the collective to the single play; <i>second</i>, from the
reproduction of traditional or accidental events to the selection of such as
possessed significance and continuity; and <i>third</i>, from the employment of
the remote in material and interest to the employment of the immediate and
familiar.</p>

<p>To attribute to the allegorical play all improvements that were made in
this transition is a mistake. Some steps in the right direction were already
necessitated by the popular demand, and had been taken by the later miracle
plays before the allegorical drama had itself passed out of the experimental
stages,&mdash;by the Digby <i>Magdalene</i>, for instance. In that play, the dramatic
management of a plot, invented and romantic rather than scriptural in its
nature and interest, and the portrayal of commonplace events and characters
side by side with the occasional allegory, are evidence not only of contemporary
taste, but, as Mr. Courthope has said, of an artistic approach to the
representation of fables of simple secular interest. The play, in fact, bears a
close resemblance to and was apparently influenced by the popular life of
St. Mary Magdalene which appeared in Caxton's translation of 1483 of the
<i>Golden Legend</i>,&mdash;or perhaps by the French edition which Caxton follows,
or the original of Voragine. In the <i>St. Paul</i> of the Digby collection we note
a similar fusion of secular and legendary material, and an imaginative handling
of the plot. Although the dramatist has buried his opportunities of psychological
invention in the apostle's homily upon the deadly sins, he has at the
same time crossed the border of the "moral play" rich with psychological
opportunity. In the same direction of advance various steps had also been
taken by other saints' plays, purely legendary, like the <i>Sancta Katharina</i>
already mentioned, and by such a 'marvel' as the Sacrament Play, or
Miracle of the Host, which we shall presently describe. A movement in
advance had, moreover, been made by our early secular drama, which comprised,
besides the farce interlude prepared by scholars for profane consumption,
like the <i>Interludium de Clerico et Puella</i>, certain popular festival plays,
for instance, the <i>Hox Tuesday</i> and <i>Robin Hood</i>, and plays of saints turned
national heroes like St. George and St. Edward.</p>

<p>Concerning the plays of the miracles of saints I have already expressed
the belief that, whether these workers of marvels got off with their lives or
not, the representations in which they figured were, generally speaking, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>
essence of comedy: the persistent optimism which in the end routs the spectres
of temptation, persecution, and unbelief. This would hold, with even greater
probability, of the purely legendary miracles, the nature of which is, of course,
that of popular religious thought and faith in the Middle Ages, and is embalmed
for us in the <i>Golden Legend</i>, in Eusebius and St. Jerome, and other writers
from whom the legend was derived. In spite of their exceeding interest,
these legendary saints' plays and pageants can be considered in this place only
with brevity; but in order that the reader may better appreciate the variety
of their subjects and the extent of the period over which they were acted, I
subjoin a list of some that we know to have been presented.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>I have little doubt that the romantic combination of tragic, marvellous, and
comic later noticeable upon the Elizabethan stage was in some degree due to
the ancient and continuous dramatization of the irrational adventures, blood-curdling
tortures, and dissonant emotions afforded by the legends of the saints.
These 'marvels,' moreover, must, because of their early emancipation from
ecclesiastical restraints and their adoption by the folk, have contributed to the
development of the freely invented, surprising, and amusing fable which is
congenial to comedy. That we have not more notices of them is owing, not
to their insignificance nor to any disappearance before the advancing popularity
of the craft cycles, for even the pageants of the saints still flourish in
Aberdeen as late as 1531, and the plays elsewhere much later, but, as Ebert
has already noted, to the fact that they were seldom presented with the magnificence
and publicity of the cyclic miracles; but whenever a saint's play is
taken up by a city or gild, it enjoys frequent official notice and maintains its
dignity for years.</p>

<p>Passing to the marvel or miracle of the Host, we notice that only one
in our language has survived. This <i>Play of the Blyssyd Sacrament</i> bears
the name of one of the East Midland Croxtons, and it was composed between
1461 and 1500. Although some critics have a low opinion of the play, I
venture to say that it is one of the most important in the early history of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
comedy. The subject, the desecration by Jews of a wonder-working
Wafer and the discomfiture and ultimate conversion of the offenders, is popular
in the legend of the later Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
With ours a Dutch Sacrament Play,
written about the year 1500 by Smeken and acted in Breda, naturally calls
for comparison; but, though the latter exhibits the miraculous power of the
Host and has a certain diabolic humour, it lacks altogether the realism, the
popular reproduction of Jewish malignity, and the effective close of the Croxton.
The Croxton avails itself of the possibilities of the subject. The idea
has a significance; the plot possesses legitimate motive, due proportions, unity
ethical and æsthetic; and the conclusion is happy. The mood, by turns
serious and comic, and the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, various and well-characterized,
combine to furnish a most diverting drama of the wonderful, horrible, elevated,
and commonplace. Colle's announcement of his master the leech, "a man off
alle syence," who "syttyth with sum tapstere in the spence," is excellently
ironical; and Master Brundych himself, like the doctor in the St. George plays,
must have furnished a figure exactly suited to the popular taste. Nor is
the realism confined to the intentionally comic scenes; but it is as vividly
successful in the corruption of Aristorius by Jonathas and in the futile and
richly avenged efforts of the Jews to torture the Host. Here certainly was a
play adapted to meet the demands of its time,&mdash;exhibiting closer affiliation
with the folk than with church or patron or school, acted perhaps by strolling
players, an unforced product of the artistic consciousness; a play which,
though it dealt with a sacred subject, still focussed itself in a single plot, discarded
all material, sacred or historical, not available for its purpose, completed
an alliance with the natural and the familiar, and emphasized the
comic realities of life. No miracle, cyclic or individual, no allegorical drama,
and no secular play of the same or previous date excels the Croxton in dramatic
concept and constructive skill. Without the mediation offered by such
Croxton plays, the English drama would have had "old" bridging the space
between miracles, marvels, and morals of the earlier time and the comedy of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The consideration of our early farce interludes may be conveniently postponed
for the present in favour of the more popular plays, or shows, with
which our forefathers celebrated festival occasions. Of the pageants in honour
of royal entries, to which reference has already been made, it is impossible to
say more here than that, developing gradually into dramatic spectacles, and at
the same time retaining their symbolic character, they must have contributed
to the taste for allegorical plays, the moral, and the moral interlude. If we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">xl</a></span>
turn to the secular shows presented on regular festivals, such as May-day,
Hox Tuesday, and the Eve of St. John and St. Peter, while we may at once
conclude that they were less efficient as dramas than some of which we have
spoken, such as the Sacrament play, they have the advantage, from our present
point of view, of indicating more directly the nature of popular demand and
the primitive conditions of popular art. Indeed, Dodsley regards the mummers
who commonly acted them as the earliest genuine comedians of England.
Of such disguisings, masks, and mummeries there is evidence in the Wardrobe
Accounts of 1389, according to which a company of twenty-one men
was disguised as the Ancient Order of the Coif for a play before the king at
Christmas; and of other mummings&mdash;not satiric nor in mockery of church
ritual, but genial&mdash;we have mention in Stow and citations in Warton and
Collier that take us to the first half of the fourteenth century. They doubtless
existed much earlier, though I do not think that they anticipated the
parodies of sacred rites or the ecclesiastical saints' plays.</p>

<p>Naturally a much-loved figure in festival games was Robin Hood, and that
some kind of drama was made out of the ballads surrounding him is proved
by a Ms. fragment of 1475 or earlier of <i>Robin Hood and the Knight</i>, and a
play of <i>Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar</i> with a portion of <i>Robin Hood and
the Potter</i>, printed by Copland, in 1550, as "very proper to be played in
May-games."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
These May-games occurred not only in May, but June, and
gave employment to St. George and the Dragon, the Nine Worthies (at
whom Shakespeare poked run in <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>), the morris-dance,
with its Lords and Ladies of the May, giant, hobby-horse, and sometimes
devils, as well as to Robin and Little John, Maid Marian, and Friar Tuck;
and they were popular through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, perhaps
even earlier. If we may trust old Fenn's editing, Sir John Paston wrote in
1473 of a man whom he had kept for three years to play "Seynt Jorge and
Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Nottingham." There may be even earlier
mention of such plays. For, with all deference to the best of authorities,
Professor Child, I cannot but think that when Bower wrote, between 1441
and 1447, of the popular "comedies and tragedies" of <i>Robertus Hode et
Litill Johanne</i>, he had reference to acted plays, since he took pains to specify
in his account of them the <i>mimi</i>, as well as the <i>bardani</i> who chanted them.
These entertainments, he says, were then more popular than any other, and
it is only natural to suppose that they had existed long before his time. The
earliest mention of Robin in England is in <i>Piers Plowman</i>, 1377, and then as
the subject of a ballad; but, as Warton long ago pointed out, pastoral plays
of <i>Robin et Marion</i> had been given in France upon festival occasions before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>
the end of the thirteenth century. Although there appears to be no similarity
between the incidents of Adam de la Halle's comic opera of 1283 upon
Robin and his Marion and the English stories, and although we are ignorant
of the nature of the spring game, or play, of the same title, which was already
an annual function in Anjou, in 1392, the principal characters and conditions of
life in the two series are sufficiently similar to suggest a connection by derivation
or common source. If such connection exist, it is not impossible that
some kind of Robin pageant or play was known in England earlier than we
ordinarily think. The ballad plays, at any rate, had attained popularity long
before an artistic level was reached by the allegorical drama, and while yet
the craft cycles were in their prime. Stow, in respect of Mayings, which he
leads us to believe were common in the reign of Henry VI., says that the
citizens of London "did fetch in May-poles with divers warlike shows, with
good archers, morris-dancers, and other devices for pastime all the day long;
and towards the evening they had stage-plays and bonfires in the streets."
Robin Hood and his archers are the heart of a Maying devised under
Henry VII. in 1505 and for Henry VIII. in 1516; and the archers of the
Maying in the time of Henry VI. are suggestive of the Robin Hood as an
accepted figure for some kind of pageant in the middle of the fifteenth century,
when Bower was writing of "comedies and tragedies," mentioned above.
The pageants and probably the plays of Robin Hood are still alive in the
seventeenth century and later. Their dramatic quality was of a very primitive
sort, but the plot, wherever existent, displayed sequence of motive and effect.
The popular dramatist had, as in the Sacrament play and saints' plays, learned
how to magnify a hero by making him the pivot of the action, how to interest
the spectators in the affairs and manners of their own class, how to produce
a comic effect by means of dialogue, as well as by the humour of the situation.
But he knew nothing of the development of character, and in that respect,
without doubt, was inferior to the contemporary author of the moral play.</p>

<p>Passing the Hox Tuesday play, of which we cannot be sure that it was
anything more than a crude and entirely serious representation of the historic
massacre which it commemorated, and of which no adequate account survives,
we may turn with profit to the most popular and long-lived of English festival
dramas, the St. George play. Of this Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps says that
numerous versions are used in the north of England, and that they are doubtless
a degraded form of an old "mystery."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Of course, he means legendary
miracle or saint's play. Ward more accurately describes this rural drama as a
combination of miracle and processional pageant. As the latter, it appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>
frequently to have formed part of a mumming or disguising, and was early
associated with the morris-dance of May-day or Christmas.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>
Collier, <i>Hist.</i>, vol. I., p. 29.
<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The first indubitable
mention of a St. George pageant is in 1416, and would appear to refer to
a "splendid dumb show" rather than a play, which, as Caxton tells us, was
presented for the entertainment of Emperor Sigismund of Almayne when he
"brought and gave the heart of St. George for a great and precious relique to
King Harry the fifth." It is, however, more than probable that the soldier
saint had figured in saints' plays, and in popular play and pageant, long before
this time. He had been honoured in the eastern church even in the fourth
century, and in England there had been churches and monasteries devoted to
him before the Norman invasion. On account of his fabled services in the
crusade he was already the patron of individual knights, and orders of chivalry
and even of kingdoms, when Edward III., in the years 1348-50, built the
chapel in his honour at Windsor, confirmed him as the saint and champion of
England and instituted the order that still bears his name. It is likely, indeed,
that the <i>ludi</i> exhibited before the same monarch at Christmas, 1348, were to
some extent of St. George, for we read that the dragon figured extensively in
them.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
And it would appear that when, in 1415, the 23d April, St. George's
Day, was "made a major double feast and ordered to be observed the same as
Christmas day, all labour ceasing," his play was no new thing. From that time
on, at any rate, the procession of St. George was one of the "pastimes yearly
used," of which Stow tells us that they were celebrated "with disguisings,
masks, and mummeries." Gilds were organized in his name, and the ceremony
of 'Riding the George' spread over England. When Henry V.
visited Paris, in 1420, he was appropriately welcomed with a St. George
show, and the saint appears again in a pageant of 1474 performed at Coventry
in honour of young Prince Edward. We have already mentioned Sir John
Paston's reference to the play in 1473. A long-winded and serious German
dramatization of the legend exists in an Augsburg manuscript of the end of the
same century. In all probability the expensive miracle play of the saint that
was acted in the croft or field at Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire, in 1511, was
of the same didactic kind, but enlivened by <i>impromptus</i> of the villagers who
took part. St. George and the dragon were features of the May-games at
London, evidently in procession, as late as 1559. There appears in Warburton's
list a play of <i>St. George for England</i>, by Wentworth Smith, of the
first quarter of the seventeenth century, and in the latter part of that century,
a droll called <i>St. George and the Dragon</i> was by way of being acted at Bartholomew
Fair. The play seems from an early date to have been performed
on the occasion of other festivals besides that of the Saint himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>
The versions of the play best known of recent years are the Oxfordshire,
acted during the eighteenth century and taken down from an old performer
in 1853, and the Lutterworth (Leicestershire) Christmas play, acted as late
as 1863.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Professor Child, in his <i>Ballads</i>, mentions another, which was
regularly acted on All Souls' Day at a village a few miles from Chester. I
would call attention, in addition, to four others of interest; the Derbyshire
Christmas play,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
acted by mummers as late as 1849, which is fuller than any
other and appears to me to retain traces of a fifteenth-century original; the
two Bassingham (Lincoln) Christmas plays,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
1823, and the Shetland play from
a 1788 Ms., recounted in Scott's novel of <i>The Pirate</i>. The last three make
the connection between the St. George play proper and the sword play, which
was undoubtedly common in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and of which
the Revesby version of 1779 is still extant.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The following is the outline of the Derbyshire play: Enter Prologue, who
is apparently the same as "noble soldier," "Slasher," or "Jack," to clear
a way for St. Gay.&mdash;Enter St. Gay, announcing himself with proper bombast,
pretending that "from England's ground he sprung and came," and stating
his purpose, which is to find King George.&mdash;Enter King George, "in search
of his enemy," St. Gay, who as "a stranger, exposed and in danger," calls
upon Slasher for help.&mdash;With loud words Slasher threatens King George,
who in his turn boasts of "close escapes," giants and dragons subdued, and
the King of Egypt's daughter won.&mdash;They fight, and Slasher "tumbles
down and dies."&mdash;Enter Doctor, who has "travelled" imaginatively and can
"fetch any dead man to life again." He begins with Slasher, who signalizes
his recovery by summoning the "Black Prince of Paradise, black Morocco
king," to renew the fray.&mdash;"Here am I," cries that hero; it was I who
"slew those seven Turks," and it is I who now will "jam King George's
giblets full of holes, And in those holes put pebble stones!" George doubts
the Black Prince's ability, even though he be a "champion's squire,"&mdash;they
are about to fight, when Prologue intervenes with "Peace and Quietness
is the best," and "Enter in, owld Beelzebub!" That personage on entering
turns out to be, in dress, a kind of Devil and Vice combined, in spirit a kind
of Father Christmas summoning all to drink.&mdash;This queer jumble is worth
more space than I can afford it. Just a word or two in passing. St. Gay is
given up by Halliwell-Phillipps as an "addition to the calendar not noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">xliv</a></span>
elsewhere." But one observes that his squire is a foreigner, as his name
and garb both proclaim,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and that he is the squire of a champion. This
limits us to the three foreign champions of Christendom, and from St. Gay's
second speech we discover, not only that he is San Diego of Spain, but (unless
I am gravely mistaken) that some author of the various generations of
authors of this play had acquaintance with Caxton's <i>Golden Legend</i> of 1483,
where, in the <i>Life of St. James the More</i>, we find the original, in oddly
similar terms, of one altogether unintelligible phrase used by this English makeshift
for a Spanish champion.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Further not very definite but suggestive similarities
with the <i>Life of St. George</i> add to the presumption that the Caxton
translation of the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> underlies portions of this folk play. Of
course a play of the martyrdom of St. George may have existed earlier still, but
if, as would seem to be the case, Voragine invented the dragon, that monster
cannot have played a part before 1270-90; it does not play a part even in
the <i>South English Legendary</i> of 1285, but is prominent in Caxton's narrative.</p>

<p>With the play just described the Lutterworth is identical in some seven or
eight passages, and save that there is no Black Prince, and that a Turkish
Champion takes the place of St. Gay, the principal characters are the same.
The introduction of Beelzebub and a clown, with remarks appropriate to each,
would, however, indicate that this part of the play is earlier than the amalgamated
Beelzebub-clown of the Derbyshire. Both plays preserve reminiscences
of the crusades. As to the Oxfordshire, I can say only that it is a rigmarole
from history, legend, and nursery tale, culminating in the destruction of
the dragon (or Old Nick) and the appearance of Father Christmas. The
Bassingham plays present the stock characters, but little of the original story.
They add elements of scandal and love, however,&mdash;the former in connection
with Dame Jane, who tries to fasten the paternity of her child on a
"Father's Eldest Son, And heir of all his land"; and the latter in connection
with a Fair Lady, who is wooed by Eldest Son, Farming Man, Lawyer, Old
Man, and refuses them all, in the end apparently to accept the Fool. This
part of the story is a link between the St. George plays and the sword-dance
plays, as is also the Shetland, where St. George himself sustains the part of
principal dancer. In the Revesby sword-dance play, acted in 1779 by morris-dancers,
the Fair Lady of the Bassingham reappears as Cicely to refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">xlv</a></span>
Pepper-breeches, "My father's eldest son, And heir of all his land,"
Ginger-breeches, Blue-breeches, the Knight of Lee, and Pickle Herring, the
Lord of Pool, in favour of Rafe the Fool. Though the phraseology of the
Bassingham and Revesby is occasionally the same, the latter is utterly removed
from the St. George original save in the mention of dragon and worm which
accompany the morris-dancers. How far back the Revesby sword-dance play
may date I do not know. The dance was common on the continent in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and a similar performance with a fool in the
middle is recorded as taking place in Ulm in 1551. The name of the merry-andrew,
Pickle Herring, may possibly take us back to the first quarter of the
sixteenth century. For, as is well known, it is the usual designation for the
clown in the 1620 collection of plays acted by the so-called English comedians
in Germany. According to Creizenach,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
the character was introduced by
Robert Reynolds, who was perhaps himself the Robert Pickelhäring mentioned
in connection with an entertainment given at Torgau in 1627. Floegel and
Ebeling speak of "der alte Pickelhering aus der Moralititäten des fünfzehnten
Jahrhunderts," as if he were the "old Vice"; but surely without justification.
I know of no mention of Pickle Herring before 1620, and since he
still held the stage in Löwen's <i>Prinz Pickelhering</i>, about the middle of the
eighteenth century, it is not impossible that the character was borrowed by
the English sword play at a comparatively recent date. The continuance of
the Devil and his relation to the clown in these plays are a subject of historical
interest, but it would be a mistake to say, as Halliwell-Phillipps has
said of the Beelzebub, that either of them is "a genuine descendant of the
Vice."</p>

<p>Perhaps I should not have stayed to make these remarks, but they will, I
hope, direct attention to a phenomenon unique in the history of English drama.
The St. George play is an example of how a legendary miracle, sacred in its
origin, may pass into a folk drama of a national hero, and that again degenerate
into a mumming or dance; and how this, oblivious of the original plot
and finally of all fable, may first transform the saintly hero into a performer in
a sword dance, as in the Shetland play, and then, as in the Revesby, eliminate
even him and substitute a fool. Both literary career and literary indignity
of this kind have been escaped by the other national saint of England,
Edward the Confessor. In earlier days he figured in frequent pageants, records
of which are preserved, for instance, in the Old Leet Book of Coventry,
of the years 1456 and 1471, but he readily gave way to St. George and disappeared
from the dramatic horizon.</p>

<h3>5. The Devil and the Vice</h3>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</a></span>
The nexus between the comic qualities of the miracle plays and those of
the morals cannot well be made without some discussion of the rôles of the
Devil and the Vice. The treatise which I have before cited,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and which
appears to me fairly conclusive, shows that the Devil of the English stage is
originally a creation, not of folk mythology, but of theology. He is concrete,
to be sure, in accordance with scriptural and legendary tradition, but in the
'mysteries' his character is almost entirely serious, not ludicrous, as appears
to be vulgarly reported. The association of the genuinely comic or satirical
with the conception of the Devil is first evident in later representations of that
character, and then only in the case of lesser denizens of the lower world.
The humorous scene in the Chester <i>Harrowing</i> between the demons and the
alewife abandoned in hell is, for instance, as Dr. Deimling has said, a late interpolation.
The Wakefield dramatist's contribution to the <i>Judicium</i>, of <i>Tutivillus</i>
and his ilk, is about the only diabolic humour in the miracles; and
that the satirical speech of the Coventry demon in the <i>Conspiracy</i> was a still
later borrowing from <i>Tutivillus</i>, I have but little doubt. To credit the
Devils of the earliest miracles with a tendency and an ability to criticise manners
and morals would be just as wrong as to attribute to them a buffoonery
which accrues only at a later date. Of the Mephistophelian style, more
serious than Chaucer's and more satirical than Langland's, we have no historical
trace before the witty Devil of Wakefield&mdash;or his maker. The
humour of the miracle Devils shows itself in bombastic, grotesque, or abusive
language, rather than in anything of comic utterance or incident. The
uproarious laughter caused, according to tradition, by this character cannot,
therefore, have depended upon the lines of the dramatist, except in so far as
those consist of threats, objurgation, profanity, and the like. There is little in
the asides of the printed page, or in the rare addresses of the Devil to his
audience, or the deportation of souls to hell<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
to account for amusement.
Rewfyn,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Rybald,
and Tutivillus are the only humorous devil-names in the
five cycles of which we have been speaking; and of the shouting and fireworks
in which we are told the infernal spirits were wont to indulge, we find
scarcely any mention except in the plays concerning the fall of the angels and
the harrowing of hell. That the merriment of the crowd was provoked by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</a></span>
the appearance and antics of the Devil&mdash;that is to say, by the improvisation
of the actor&mdash;and his raids upon the spectators is natural to infer. The
dramatists themselves did not provide for close association between the spirits
of hell and living men. The Devil addresses the audience but seldom, and
then, perhaps, to threaten with his club. In fact, the Devil of the old
miracles, as we usually conceive him, is an anachronism created by certain
historians of the drama; the buffoon roaring, pyrotechnic, and familiar,
springs into prominence only with the Digby plays, and is but slowly developed
in the moral plays and interludes. Though the aspiring angels of
the York and Chester plays "go down" in actual fact, and the Lucifer of
the former cycle complains of heat and smoke, there is no mention of hell-mouth
in the account-books before 1557, nor in the stage directions of
the Digby<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
before we reach the Digby <i>Paul</i> and <i>Magdalene</i> Mss. of about
1480-90; and even then the entries appear to be the insertions of some later
hand. In these plays the flames of hell-mouth, the fireworks, and thunder
are distinctive accessories of the Devil's presence. Still, it is not in a miracle
play after all, but in a moral&mdash;the <i>Castell of Perseverance</i> (about 1400)&mdash;that
the first stage direction of this nature is found. In the transitional
miracle morals, <i>Paul</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Magdalene</i>, the Devil by his own account
as well as by stage direction "rores and cries." He was abusive in the
<i>Castell of Perseverance</i>; but in the later morals or moral interludes he
"rores and cries" for mere fun&mdash;in the <i>Lusty Juventus</i>, for instance, the
<i>Disobedient Child</i>, and <i>All for Money</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the Devil even of this later birth, many false conceptions, due
to insufficient research, have obtained currency. It is commonly imagined
that he was the mainspring of the play, that he came into close contact with
human beings, that he represented phases of human character, that he was a
comical figure,&mdash;jester, or "roister," or butt,&mdash;and that he held some fixed
relation to the Vice, who was "his constant attendant," says Malone.
But the Devil was the principal personage only in the earliest of the morals
that survive, he rarely associated with mankind, and he assumed the human
rôle, such as that of judge or sailor, only once or twice.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In the moral plays
not more than four or five comic Devils are extant&mdash;the Titivillus of <i>Mankynd</i>,
the Beelzebub of the <i>Nigromansir</i>, the Lucifer of <i>Like wil to Like</i>,
and the Devil of <i>All for Money</i>; and the last of these is the only roysterer of
the lot, one of the very few to serve as butt for the Vice. Such jokes as that
of the Devil taking "a shrewd boy with him" from the audience in <i>Wisdom</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</a></span>
are interpolations, and it is only after the moral has passed its zenith that,
as in <i>Like wil to Like</i> and the early comedy <i>Friar Bacon</i>, the Devil carries
off the Vice-clown. As early as 1486-1500 the moral play, <i>Nature</i>,&mdash;called,
when printed in 1538, a goodly interlude,&mdash;dispenses with the Devil
altogether, and from that time on the character appears only in some half-dozen
extant plays of the kind and its derivatives, and is subordinate. Towards
the end of the sixteenth century, however, the Devil is revived, and in comedies
of concrete life and character he frequently swaggers as a blusterer or
comic personage: in <i>Grim the Collier</i>, for instance, in the <i>Knack to know a
Knave</i>, and <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>, as well as seventeenth-century plays like <i>The
Devil is in It</i> and <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. I have said that his office in
the genuine moral was not comic, neither was it satirical. It consisted largely
in directing or commissioning his agents, the Vices. Professor Cushman, who
makes this statement, further points out that this conception of the Devil did
not develop in any popular sense, nor gain in variety in the English moral
plays; but that the case is altogether dissimilar in the German and French
drama of the same period, where the devils are not only numerous, but
carefully differenced as representatives of the various foibles of mankind,&mdash;a
rôle which was assumed in England, as we shall presently see, by the
Vice.</p>

<p>Between the detached, and sometimes serious, Devil of the cycles and the
Vice of the moral plays, ever present, dominant and comical, concrete in manifold
person and guise, a middle or transitional position is occupied by the fiend
of the later miracle and the demon of the earlier moral. Examples of the
former are Tutivillus and his humorous associates in the Wakefield <i>Judicium</i>,
Lord Lucifer of the Coventry <i>Council</i> (who, like the Vice, euphemizes his
attendant Deadly Sins), the Prynse of Dylles of the <i>Magdalene</i>, and the sailor
devil of the Newcastle play; examples of the latter are the gunpowder Belial
of <i>Perseverance</i>, the intriguing Lucifer of <i>Wisdom</i>, now in "devely aray,"
anon as a "prowde galaunt," the farcical and efficient Titivillus of <i>Mankynd</i>,
and Beelzebub, the judge and buffoon of the <i>Nigromansir</i>. But though the
demon of the morals bears some relation to his predecessor of the miracles, he
is not borrowed from the miracles. He grows out of a common tradition.</p>

<p>Just as the Devil persists in spite of lapse and change through miracle play,
moral, and interlude into Elizabethan comedy, so the Vice, though he did not
obtain so early a footing upon the stage. There are previsions of him in the
later miracles and earlier morals; he flourished in the morals of the middle
period and the moral interludes, and there are traces of him in the regular
comedy. He disappeared only in deference to the differentiated humours,
follies, or vices of social life, of which no controlling Folly or Vice may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">xlix</a></span>
regarded as the sole incarnation,&mdash;for in the culture of them each of us
indulges a genius of his own.</p>

<p>The term Vice is not used as the designation of a stock dramatic character
till the appearance of Heywood's <i>Play of the Wether</i> and <i>Play of Love</i>,
before or about 1532. It is next employed in <i>Respublica</i>, 1553, and <i>Jacke
Jugeler</i>, 1553-61. These and similar notices of that period, however,
occur only on title-pages of plays or in lists or stage directions. The earliest
mention of the Vice in the text of a play is found in <i>King Darius</i>, 1565.
It is not until 1567, with the <i>Horestes</i>, that we find the designation "used
consistently throughout, in the title, the list of players and the rubric."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But whether the generic name of Vice was introduced by the authors of these
plays, or, as is more likely, by the actors, it was a well-known designation
of a stock figure, especially in the moral drama from 1530 onward; and from
that time was used by publishers to advance the interest of certain plays.
Since, however, the idea of the Vice seems to be inseparable from that of the
moral play, the character had achieved a prominence long before it was
listed as a generic designation. Collier defines the moral, or moral interlude,
as "A drama the characters of which are allegorical, abstract, or
symbolical, and the style of which is intended to convey a lesson for the
better conduct of human life." And the differencing quality of the moral is,
as Mr. Pollard has said, "the contest between the personified powers of good
and evil for the possession of a human soul. As the allegorical representatives
of the good were the Seven Cardinal Virtues, so the representatives of the
evil were the Seven Deadly Sins and their master the Devil." From these
Seven Deadly Sins or Vices, the Vice <i>par excellence</i> of the morals and interludes
is without doubt descended. With the opinion of Ward and Douce,
however, that he is proved to be of native English origin, I cannot unreservedly
concur; nor with a statement in the thesis to which I have already
referred, that the Germans and French had no Vice, but used instead the
"differentiated" devil. Idleness, a Vice, though not so called, appears in
the French <i>Bien-Avisé et Mal-Avisé</i> (<i>c.</i> 1439), about as early as any Vice
appears in English drama; and the four confederates of the Devil in <i>L'Homme
Pêcheur</i>, Desperation, etc., perform the office, though they have not the
designation, of Vice. The Hypocrisie and Simonie of Gringoire's attack
upon <i>L'Homme Obstiné</i> (Julius II.), about 1512, are as true representatives
of the Vice as are the corresponding figures in <i>The Nigromansir</i>, <i>Thrie
Estatis</i>, <i>Kyng Johan</i>, <i>Respublica</i> and <i>Conflict of Conscience</i>.</p>

<p>To understand the relations between the Vice and the moral play one
should turn, if there were opportunity, to the manifold representations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">l</a></span>World, the Flesh, the Devil, the Seven Deadly Sins and similar allegorical
figures in mediæval literature of other kinds than the dramatic. It must
suffice here, however, to consider the relation of these characters to each other
in the later miracles and the earlier moral plays. In the pageants of the <i>Play
of Paternoster</i> the Seven Deadly Sins are represented. About the same
time, in the Wakefield cycle, they are already written on the rolls of the
Doomsday Demon, and discussed "in especiall" by Tutivillus. In the
Coventry <i>Council of the Jews</i> they are new-named by their Lord Lucifer
(after the manner of the later Vice), Pride as Honesty, Wrath as Manhood,
Covetousness as Wisdom, and so on. It is through the Seven Deadly
Sins that the Belial of St. Paul (Digby) "raynes"; and the Saint himself<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
preaches against them in general and in several, calling them not only mortal
sins, but, as if the terms were synonymous, Vices and Folly. In the
<i>Mary Magdalene</i> they are not only personified, but, further, classified as
attendants upon their respective kings&mdash;Pride and Covetyse, ministers of the
World; Lechery, Gluttony, and Sloth, of the Flesh; Wrath and Envy, of
the Devil,&mdash;and as such they are sent into action. This distinction by classes
is interesting because it shows that from a very early date the Vice was regarded
as the servant, not of the Devil alone, but of the World and the Flesh as well.
And it will be noticed later that, while the minor Vices of the moral interludes
frequently bear the names of specific sins, the leading Vice is still likely to be
called by a name which sums up all the specific sins of just one of these three
satrapies of the Flesh, the World, the Devil,&mdash;Sensuality for the first,
Hypocrisy or Avarice for the second, and Sedition or Riot for the third,&mdash;when
he is not indicated by some synonym of Evil in general, such as Folly,
Sin, Iniquity, Inclination, or Infidelity. Gradually the minor Vices pass into
dramatic insignificance as compared with their principal representative, who
becomes the Vice in chief. The morals before 1500 or thereabouts had one
or more of the following figures: Devil, the World, the Flesh; and their
representatives, the Vice and minor Vices or Deadly Sins. Of these plays&mdash;<i>Perseverance</i>,
<i>Mankynd</i>, <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Nature</i>, and <i>Everyman</i>,&mdash;all
but the last three display the complete aggregation: <i>Wisdom</i> stars with
only a Devil, <i>Nature</i> lacks a Devil, and <i>Everyman</i> lacks both Devil and principal
Vice. The morals of the middle period, 1500 to 1560, generally
eliminate the Devil and concentrate the sins, temptations, and mischiefs in
the Vice, sometimes with, sometimes without, his foils, the minor Vices. In
the <i>Castell of Perseverance</i>, about 1400, the Deadly Sins are "children of the
Devil"; in <i>The World and Child</i>, about 1506, they are expressly summed
up in one Vice,&mdash;Folly; in <i>Lusty Juventus</i>, <i>Like wil to Like</i>, and several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">li</a></span>other moral interludes after 1550, the Vice parades as son or grandson
to the Devil; and finally, about 1578, while each of the minor Vices
represents "one sin particularly," the Vice himself embodies "all sins
generally."</p>

<p>It must be sufficiently evident by this time that the derivation of this
name, in spite of a half-dozen misleading conjectures, is no other than that
which is obvious. I notice, however, that Mr. Pollard regards the etymology
from <i>vitium</i> as still doubtful, "because in one of the earliest instances
in which the Vice is specifically mentioned by name, he plays the part of Mery
Report, who is a jester pure and simple, without any connection with any
of the Deadly Sins." But the Vice or Folly had been known for two or
three centuries in allegorical and satirical literature, and for a century and
a half in the religious drama before 1530, and the designation had acquired
a supplementary and degraded connotation when used in the <i>Wether</i>, <i>Jacke
Jugeler</i>, etc., as a player's term or means of advertisement. About his function
and habits, also, various misconceptions have gathered. I have, for instance,
referred to Malone's statement that he was a constant attendant upon
the Devil. Nothing could be more misleading. The Devil appears in at
least two morals unattended by a Vice of any kind,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and the Vice appears
in twenty-five or thirty without a Devil. They appear together in but eight<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
that I know of; and in only four<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> can the Vice be said to "attend." That
he eggs the demons on to twit or torment the Devil, I cannot discover
in more than two plays,&mdash;<i>Like wil to Like</i>, and <i>All for Money</i>. Since
the days of Harsnet and Ben Jonson it has been reported that the Vice of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries made a practice of riding to hell on the
Devil's back. But I have already pointed out that he does this in only
one play before 1580. The same <i>Like wil to Like</i> is the only play in
which he specifically "belabours the fiend." I know of no other in which
that merriment was even likely to occur. In fact most of these attributions
belong, not to the Vice of the morals and interludes, but to one of the later
substitutes for him, the Vice-clown, such as Miles in <i>Friar Bacon</i>, or Iniquity
in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>.</p>

<p>A general view of his history shows, then, that the Vice is neither an
ethical nor dramatic derivative of the Devil; nor is he a pendant to that
personage, as foil or ironical decoy, or even antagonist. The Devil of the
early drama is a mythical character, a fallen archangel, the anthropomorphic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">lii</a></span>
Adversary. The Vice, on the other hand, is allegorical,&mdash;typical of the
moral frailty of mankind. Proceeding from the concept of the Deadly Sins,
ultimately focussing them, he dramatizes the evil that springs from within.
Though at first directed by God's Adversary, who assails man with temptations
from without, the Vice is the younger contemporary of the Devil rather
than his agent. As he acquires personality, he assumes characteristics and
functions unknown to the Adversary, scriptural or dramatic. The functions
were gradually assimilated with those of mischief-maker, jester, and counterfeit-crank;
the characteristics, more and more affected by the Fool-literature
of Wireker, Lydgate, Brandt and Barclay, Skelton, and the rest (which
included vice in Folly, and by the Fool connoted vicious characters in all
variety), were insensibly identified with social rather than abstract ethical
qualities, and so came to be distributed as tendencies or "humours" among
the persons of the drama,&mdash;who themselves are no longer allegorical, but
representative of the concrete individuals of everyday life. Though the
conduct of the interlude Vice may be anything but dignified, his function
was, accordingly, at first serious. It was only gradually, and as the conflict
between good and evil was supplanted by less didactic materials,&mdash;in
other words, as the moral became more of a play,&mdash;that the Vice grew to be
farcical, a mischief-maker, and ultimately jester. So long as he acts the
seducer in disguise, and the marplot, he remains dramatically supreme.
When he, however, assumes the rôle of parasite, counterfeit-crank, or
simple, he enhances the variety of his fascination at the expense of his
distinctive quality; and when he once has identified himself with the Will
Summer, the actor, wag, or buffoon by profession, he plays below the function
and level of his pristine quality. The Vice proper should, therefore,
not be confounded with the Shakespearean fool, nor with the country clown.
The country clown or booby he in reality never is; indeed, in some earlier manifestations<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
the clown exists contemporaneously with the Vice, and is his natural
though not always complaisant quarry. Though the Vice, however, did
not turn clown, the clown imperceptibly usurped qualities of the vanishing
Vice.</p>

<p>In connection with the misconception concerning the derivation of the
Vice from the domestic fool, of course incompatible with his descent from
the Deadly Sins, there lingers a report that he was ordinarily dressed in a fool's
habit. Such is the opinion of Klein<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and Douce; and Morley<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> writes, "The
Vice, when not in disguise, wore&mdash;as Brandt or Barclay would have thought
most fitting&mdash;the dress of a fool." The dress of some typical fool of everyday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">liii</a></span>
life, some social "crank,"&mdash;yes; but not until the latter third of the sixteenth
century, when the Vice was in his dotage, did he lose himself in the
habit of the domestic fool. The Vice "shaking his wooden dagger," of
whom Ben Jonson gives us a glimpse in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> and <i>The Staple
of News</i>, is without doubt the domestic fool in the characteristic long coat, or
in the juggler's jerkin with false skirts. But we must remember that Ben
Jonson was writing some sixty or seventy years after the Vice properly so
called was in his prime. From 1450 to 1570 and later, the distinctive Vice
of the moralities was accoutred in the costume of his rôle, first of a Deadly
Sin or little "dylfe"; then of some social class, trade, or type: messenger,
herald, beggar, rat-catcher, priest, pharisee, gallant, dandy, or 'cit.' Occasionally
he assumed a succession of costumes according to this dramatic necessity.
He was indeed frequently equipped, in addition, with horn spectacles
and wooden dagger, and sometimes with a burlesque of ceremonious attire,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
or he was furnished with squibs and other fireworks,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> or with hangman's rope
or bridle. Professor Cushman surmises that he was, even, sometimes made
up like Punch, for instance, in <i>Horestes</i> and <i>Cambyses</i>. I don't know about
that, but of this we may be sure, that as a Vice he was not distinguished
by the traditional costume of the domestic fool. That character, soon
to play an important part in comedy, appropriated certain tricks and aspects
of the Vice, but the distinctive figure of the moral drama did not proceed
from or ape the domestic fool of contemporary life.</p>

<p>Oddly enough it has lately been asserted that this character had no part
in the 'morality' proper. An implication to the same effect is to be found in
Halliwell-Phillipps's notes to <i>Witt and Wisdome</i> as early as 1846, where he
says that "the Vice is the buffoon of the old moral plays which <i>succeeded</i> the
Reformation." The fact is that the Vice takes part in all the plays under
consideration, whether called morals proper or moral interludes, from 1400
to 1578, except only <i>Wisdom</i> of the pre-Reformation series and the <i>Disobedient
Child</i> of the post-Reformation. Two other of the thirty-odd morals
and moral interludes, namely, the <i>Pride of Life</i> and <i>Everyman</i>, resort to a
substitute. They distribute the rôle among minor representatives of the World,
Flesh, and Devil, but they do not dispense with the idea of the Vice.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> From
him proceeds most of the human interest of these earlier comedies. Like the
inclinations that he personifies, he is first sinful, then venial, then amusing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">liv</a></span>and to his tradition the comedy of a later age owes more than we are wont to
suspect. It owes to him the development of certain spiritual characteristics, a
cynical but rollicking superiority to sham, a freedom from the thrall of social
and religious externality, a reckless joy of living, but an aloofness, withal, and
a humour requisite to the exercise of satire. It is, indeed, as satirist sometimes
virulent, but usually jocose, that the Vice is most to be esteemed.
In so far as the genial character of the domestic fool of Green, Lodge, or
Shakespeare reflected his irony and shrewd wit, some memory of him survived;
and the clown-Vice of <i>Friar Bacon</i> renews a passage or two of his
later career, but not every usurper of his comic appanage, his mimicry, puns,
irrelevance, and horse-play can lay claim to be descended from the Vice.</p>

<p>The dramatic importance of this figure can therefore not be overrated.
He forms the <i>callida junctura</i> between religious and secular, didactic and
artistic, ideal and tangible, in our early comedy. He found a house of correction
and he left a stage. Garcios, Pilates, Doomsday demons, and Maks
precede, or flit beside him; but he, with his ancestral Sins, dependent Follies,
and succeeding Ironies and Humours, occupies the central and the foremost
place. Even while representing the superfluity of naughtiness with an eye
to its reprobation, he is the life of the 'moral,'&mdash;its apology for artistic
existence, its appeal to human interest. But when he steals a further
march and rounds up for ridicule the very components of the allegorical
drama that are most removed from laughter, and most liable thereto,&mdash;the
long-faced abstractions that regard the comic spirit as sinful and are impervious
to a joke,&mdash;he fulfils his destiny. He is the dramatic salt and solvent
of the moral play. At first it couldn't thrive without him; at last it
couldn't thrive with him. For, what <i>raison d'être</i> could a moral have that
no longer regarded the comic as immoral, knew a joke at sight, perhaps
adventured one on its own account? Step by step with the development
of a popular æsthetic interest in the affairs of common men the playwright
asserted his superiority to social and allegorical make-believes, and the Vice
proved his utility as a dramatic reagent. Once the Vice had gathered all sins
in himself, his career was from 'inclination' to 'humour,' from abstract to
concrete, from the moral to the typical, the one to the many, and so from
the service of allegory to that of interlude, moral and pithy, but merry, all in
preparation for farce, and social and romantic comedy.</p>

<h3>6. The Relation between Miracle, Moral, and Interlude</h3>

<p>An unfortunate misapprehension has obtained currency to the effect that
there was a deliberate transition, chronological and logical, from the miracle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">lv</a></span>
cycle to the "morality," and thence to a something entirely different, called
the interlude; and it is supposed that definite advances in the development of
comedy were made <i>pari passu</i> with this transition. It is even said, by one
of the most genial and learned of English scholars, who of course was not
intending anything by way of scientific accuracy, at the time, that "in the
progress of the drama, Moralities followed Mysteries, and were succeeded by
Interludes. When folk tired of Religion on the Stage they took to the inculcation
of morality and prudence; and when this bored them they set up
Fun."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But the moral play<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was rather a younger contemporary and complement
of the miracle than a follower, or a substitute for it. Moreover,
allegory in the acted drama commanded the attention of the public contemporaneously
with the scriptural plays of the later fourteenth century; in literature
it had occupied attention long before. People, therefore, did not wait
until they were tired of religion upon the stage, before taking to the inculcation
of morality; nor could they have hoped to escape religion by any such substitute.
Moral plays, like plays which were originally liturgical, aimed at
religious instruction. But as the scriptural-liturgical illustrated the forms of
the church service and its narrative content, the moral illustrated the sermon
and the creed. The former dealt with history and ritual, the latter with
doctrine; the former made the religious truth concrete in scriptural figures
and events, the latter brought it home to the individual by allegorical
means. The historical course of the drama was not from the scriptural play
to the allegorical, but from the collective miracle and collective moral, practically
contemporary, to the individual miracle and individual moral. The dramatic
quality of the moral was, as we shall presently remark, not the same as
that of the miracle, but it neither supplanted nor fully supplemented that of the
miracle.</p>

<p>The distinction between 'morality' and 'interlude' has likewise been
unduly and illogically emphasized. The former term may properly be said to
indicate the content and aim of a drama; the latter, its garb and occasion;
but the essential characters of the moral play, the human hero and the representatives
of good and evil contending for his soul, may be common to interlude
and 'morality' alike, and both terms may with justice refer to the same
drama. After 1500 the rôle of hero is, to be sure, sometimes filled by
an historical character, or by one or mere concrete personages representative
of a type; but it must not be supposed that the play possessing such a hero is
therefore to be called an interlude, for similar heroes are to be found in the
morals before 1500. Nor should the statement be accepted that morals are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">lvi</a></span>distinguished from interludes by the presence in the former of both Devil and
Vice; for several interludes of a later date have both Devil and Vice, while
some of the earlier morals, written before 1500, have but one or the other of
these characters, or neither.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The attempt to characterize the moral by its
professed didactic intent, and the interlude by the lack thereof or the profession
of mirth, is equally unavailing; for that manifest moral, the <i>Pride of Life</i>,
one of the earliest extant, makes explicit promise in its prologue "of mirth
and eke of kare" from "this our game"; while <i>Mankynd</i>, a moral of 1461
to 1485, which advertises no amusement, is as full of it as any late interlude.
On the other hand, several plays written after 1568, calling themselves
"comedies or enterludes," and promising brevity and mirth, are tedious.
But, for the advertisement, sub-title, or specification of the play we must of
course hold the publisher, and not the author, generally responsible. The
common belief that 'moralities' were succeeded by 'interludes' is probably
due in large part to the fact that 'interlude' has been used in England
at different periods for entirely different kinds of entertainment, some of which,
notably that to which Collier in 1831 restricted the term,&mdash;the play after the
style of Heywood,&mdash;were of later production than the moral. But other
kinds of 'interlude' date back to 1300, and precede the first mention of the
moral play; while later kinds include the moral, and finally are synonymous
with any humorous and popular performance. Collier's restriction of the
term was, therefore, unfortunate. It interpreted a <i>genus</i> as a species; for,
although the interlude was originally any short entertainment, occupying the
pauses between graver negotiations of the palate or intellect, it had, in the
course of its history, acquired a significance almost as broad as 'drama'
itself. The interlude was of various form and content and covered many
species. As farce, the interlude anticipated moral plays; as allegorical drama,
it absorbed them; and as comedy, it is their younger contemporary. It is
not merely the play after the style of John Heywood. It is long or short;
religious, moral, pedagogic, political, or doctrinal; scriptural, allegorical, or
profane; classical or native; imaginative or reproductive of the commonplace;
stupid or humorous; satirical or purely comic. It seems to me, therefore,
unwise to perpetuate a distinction between moral plays and interludes which
was not recognized by those who wrote and heard the plays in question.</p>

<p>The reduction of the number of actors, the abbreviation of the play, the
concentration of the plot, wherever these exist in the later morals or moral
interludes, are not evidence of a change of kind, but merely of a natural evolution
through a period of some two hundred years. When ten Brink says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">lvii</a></span>that the interlude was the species best adapted to further the development of
dramatic art, we must understand by interlude the individual, as opposed to
the collective drama,&mdash;or the occasional performance by professionals for the
delectation, and sometimes at the order, of private persons or parties, as opposed
to expository or perfunctory plays, plays manipulated by crafts, or associated
with times, places, and ends external to art. The improvement in scope and
elasticity which marks the individual play is due to various causes: to patronage,
which prefers amusement to instruction, and the work of artists to that
of journeymen; to the development accordingly of a bread-and-butter profession
of acting, with its accompanying <i>stimuli</i> of necessity and opportunity.
Poetic invention, dramatic constructiveness and style, are sometimes spurred
by hunger; they are always responsive to the appreciation of the cultivated,
and maybe to the reward.</p>

<h3>7. The Older Morals in their Relation to Comedy</h3>

<p>The remaining dramas within the compass of this survey may be considered
in the following order: first, the older morals and moral interludes, between
the years 1400 and 1520; second, various experiments of native and foreign,
classical and romantic, origin which distinguish a period of transition extending
approximately from 1520 to 1553; and, third, some nine or ten plays
of prime importance which succeed these and unite, in one way or another,
qualities of structure and aim hitherto distinctive of separate dramatic kinds.
The period during which these plays, which I shall venture to call polytypic,
were produced, roughly coincides with the years 1545 to 1566, and among
these plays are the first English comedies really worthy of the name. We
must then notice a group of rudimentary survivals, some of which, falling
between 1550 and 1570, illustrate simply an artificial adaptation of the
'moral' species, while other few, appearing between 1553 and 1580, are a
persistent flowering of the decadent stock, fruitless in kind but genuine in comic
quality. We shall finally pass in brief review the crude romantic plays of morals
or intrigue or popular tradition written between 1570 and 1590. And if
it were not for lack of space, we should also glance at the satirical comedies
which appeared when Shakespeare was beginning and Greene was ceasing;
but, so far as possible, I must omit all subjects to which any consideration has
elsewhere been accorded in this volume.</p>

<p>A sympathetic examination of the older morals&mdash;those that were produced
before 1520&mdash;will reveal, even though the period is comparatively early,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">lviii</a></span>a twofold character of composition. We find, on the one hand, plays interpretative
of ideals of life, constructive in character, relying upon the fundamentally
allegorical, and making principally for a didactic end. We find, on
the other hand, plays that deal with the actual have a critical aim, reproduce
appearances and manners, and tend toward the amusing and satirical.</p>

<p>Of the half-dozen morals that made for the development of constructive
or interpretative comedy, one of the earliest (about 1400) and most important
was the <i>Castell of Perseverance</i>. In the quality of its dramatic devices
it sustains a close relation to the Digby <i>Magdalene</i>,&mdash;the siege of the Castell
by the Seven Deadly Sins, and their repulse under the roses which the Virtues
have discharged. It also makes use of characters already prominent in the
eleventh Coventry play, the <i>Pax</i> and <i>Misericordia</i>, who there, as here, intercede
for mankind. Collier calls this a well-constructed and much varied allegory, and
says with good reason that its completeness indicates predecessors in the same
kind. It is itself an early treatment of a fruitful theme, variously handled
in later plays like Marlowe's <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, and in narratives like <i>The Holy
War</i>. Though the abstractions are not of a highly dramatic character, still one
or two of them,&mdash;for instance <i>Detractio</i>, the Vice, who is a cousin of the
Coventry Backbiter, and of <i>Invidia</i>, "who dwellyth in Abbeys ofte," foreshadow
the comedy of manners and satire, that is to say, the comedy of criticism.
Other morals or moral interludes of the constructive kind, which I
must forbear to describe, even though they contributed in one way or another
to the improvement of dramatic consciousness or skill, are the <i>Pride of Life</i>, of
antiquity perhaps as high as the preceding; the <i>Wisdom that is Christ</i>, 1480-1490,
a comedy in the mediæval sense, insomuch as it portrays the ultimate
triumph of a hero in his contest with temptation; <i>Mundus et Infans</i>, printed
1522, but written perhaps by the beginning of the century, which, beside
giving us a vivid satirical picture of low life, makes a twofold contribution
to the technique of comedy,&mdash;an iteration of crises in plot, and a sequence of
changes in the character of the hero; Skelton's <i>Magnyfycence</i>, 1515-1523,
significant for "vigour and vivacity of diction," and his <i>Nigromansir</i>, written
somewhat earlier, which, though now lost, appears by Warton's account to
have contributed, by its attack upon ecclesiastical abuses, to the beginnings of
satirical comedy; the <i>Moralle Play of the Somonynge of Everyman</i>, printed
before 1531, but of uncertain date of composition,&mdash;a tragedy to be sure,
but "one of the most perfect allegories ever formed." All these, even when
not purposively comic or even entertaining, assist the dramatic presentation of
an imaginative ideal; occasionally also, though less directly, they contribute
to dramatic satire and the portrayal of manners.</p>

<p>Of moral plays written before 1520 that contributed to the comedy of real
life and critical intent we still have three or four. <i>Mankynd</i>&mdash;somewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">lix</a></span>
between 1461 and 1485&mdash;is of prime importance to the comedy of the
actual, for practically its only claim to consideration as an allegorical or didactic
production is that it maintains the plan and purpose of the moral play.
Its dramatic tendency is altogether away from the abstract. In spite of its
stereotyped Mercie and Myscheff, its minor Vices, and its Devil, it is a
somewhat coarse but amusing portrayal of the manners of contemporary
ne'er-do-weels. Attach no more meaning to the names Newgyse, Nowadays,
and Nowte than the chuckling audience did, or change them to Huntyngton
of Sanston, Thuolay of Hanston, and Pycharde of Trumpyngton,
and you perceive at once that the individuality, conversation, and behaviour
of these characters, and even of the hero, when he is not "holyer than ever
was ony of his kyn," are hardly less natural and concrete than those of Englishmen
immortalized by Heywood, Udall, and William Stevenson. The
plot, to be sure, is dramatically futile, the incidents farcical, the merriment
anything but refined; but there are few merrier successors of the Wakefield
Tutivillus than his namesake here, who, coming "invysybull," cometh for all
that "with his legges under him" and "no lede on his helys" to inform
the sanctimonious hero that "a schorte preyere thyrlyth hewyn" and the
audience that "the Devil is dead." Like the devil-judge of the <i>Nigromansir</i>
and the devil-sailor of the <i>Shipwrights' Play</i>, he has shaken off his biblical
conventions (if he ever had any), he associates familiarly with characters of
all kinds, and is marked by his grotesque devices as a wilful worker of confusion,
the marplot of the play. The dog-Latin of the Vice Myscheff stands
half-way between that of the Wakefield plays and that of <i>Roister Doister</i> and
<i>Thersytes</i>; and the Sam Wellerisms of Newgyse are a fine advance in the
reproduction of the vulgar. His "Beware! quod the goode-wyff, when
sche smot of here husbondes hede," and his "Quod the Devill to the
frerys," and other gayeties perilous to quote&mdash;there is something Rabelaisian
in all this. So Nowte and Nowadays, with their racy idioms, their variegated
oaths, and "allectuose ways," are to the manner born, neither new
nor old; they are of the picaresque drama that finds a welcome in every age
and land. It is worth while to notice also the parallelism of crudity and
progress in the technical devices of the action: on the one hand, the exchange
of garments by which a change of motive is symbolized, a ruse that only
gradually yields to the manifestation of character by means of action; and on
the other hand, the legitimate and dramatic parody of a scene in court.</p>

<p>The concrete element so noteworthy in Mankynd is further developed in
the "<i>Goodly Interlude of Nature</i>, compylyde by" Archbishop Morton's
chaplain, Henry Medwall, between 1486 and 1500. This author must
have possessed a remarkably vivid imagination, or have enjoyed a closer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">lx</a></span>
acquaintance than might be expected of one of his cloth with the seamy side
of London; for there are few racier or more realistic bits of description in
our early literature than the account given by Sensuality of Fleyng Kat and
Margery, of the perversion of the hero by the latter, and of her retirement
when deserted to that house of "Strayt Religyon at the Grene Freres hereby,"
where "all is open as a gose eye." Though the plot is not remarkable,
nor the mechanism of it, for almost the only device availed of is that of
feigned names, still the author's insight into the conditions of low life,
his common sense, his proverbial philosophy, his humorous exhibition of
the morals of the day, and his stray and sudden shafts at the foibles of
his own religious class, would alone suffice to attract attention to this work.
And even more remarkable than this in the history of comedy is Medwall's
literary style: his versification excellent and varied, his conversations witty,
idiomatic, and facile. Indeed, he is so far beyond the ordinary convention
that he writes the first bit of prose to be found in our drama.</p>

<p>Several of the characteristics of <i>Mankynd</i> are carried forward also in the
moral "interlude," named, not for its hero Free Will, but for its Vice,
<i>Hyckescorner</i>. It appears to have been written between 1497 and 1512.
The upper limit of production is fixed by the reference to Newfoundland,
and perhaps by the fact that in the same year Locher's translation of the
<i>Narrenschiff</i> appeared; the lower limit by the mention of the ship <i>Regent</i>,
which would not probably have been referred to as existing after 1512.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Indeed, the mention of the ship <i>James</i> may associate the lower limit with
1503, the date of the Scotch marriage. The tendency of this moral is distinctively
didactic,&mdash;to denounce the folly that scoffs at religion,&mdash;but in
quality it smacks more of comedy than any preceding play. Its value was
long ago acknowledged by Dr. Percy. "Abating the moral and religious
reflections and the like," says he, "the piece is of a comic cast, and contains
a humorous display of some of the vices of the age. Indeed, the author
has generally shown so little attention to the allegorical that we need only to
substitute other names to his personages, and we have real characters and
living manners." The plot is insignificant, but the situations are refreshingly
humorous, and one of them, the setting of Pity in the stocks, is new. The
local references are frequent, and the dialogue is more sprightly than even
that of <i>Nature</i>. <i>Hyckescorner</i> is in many ways the model of another important
play of which we shall soon have reason to speak, the <i>Interlude of
Youth</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">lxi</a></span>
While the plot of the <i>New Interlude and Mery of the Nature of the Four
Elements</i>, calls for no special notice, it interests us because in purpose it is not
moral, but scientific, and in conduct makes use of comic and commonplace
means not previously availed of. The humour proceeds not simply from the
jumble of oaths, nicknames, proverbs, gibes, bad puns, transparent jokes,
mimicry, Sam Wellerisms, and <i>nugae canorae</i> of which the talk of most Vices
consists, but from the cleverly managed verbal misunderstanding between the
Vice and the Taverner, the irrelevant question, and the humorous employment
of snatches and tags from popular songs. The introduction of a
character representing a trade, such as that of the Taverner, who enumerates
sixteen kinds of wine, and "by his face seems to love best drinking," is, of
course, novel, but is not without precedent in the miracle plays. This
interlude was printed in 1519 by its author, John Rastell, evidently soon after
it was written.</p>

<p>When we consider that the <i>Four Elements</i> was written by a friend of Sir
Thomas More, and that, like the plays of John Heywood, another of More's
friends, it depends for much of its effect upon its gibes at womankind, we are,
perhaps, assisted in realizing the extent to which the literary taste of the day
still indulged in this primitive form of amusement, and the distance which was
yet to be covered before comedy could safely avail itself of the feminine element
as it is,&mdash;witty and practical, as well as tender,&mdash;and so prepare to
fulfil its peculiar function as the conserver of society. For, until it recognizes
that women constitute the social other-half, the comic spirit has not come
into full possession of its possibilities; it has not produced comedy, for it has
not given us a full and undistorted reflex of life. This is a fact so rarely considered
that I cannot refrain from quoting Mr. George Meredith. "Comedy,"
he says, in his excellent essay on its <i>Idea</i>&mdash;"comedy lifts women to a station
offering them free play for their wit, as they usually show it, when they have
it, on the side of sound sense. The higher the comedy, the more prominent
the part they enjoy in it.... The heroines of comedy are like women
of the world, not necessarily heartless for being clear-witted: they seem so to
the sentimentally reared only for the reason that they use their wits, and are
not wandering vessels crying for a captain or a pilot. Comedy is an exhibition
of their battle with men, and of men with them: and as the two,
however divergent, both look on one object, namely, life, the gradual similarity
of their impressions must bring them to some resemblance. The comic
poet dares to show us men and women coming to this mutual likeness; he is
for saying that, when they draw together in social life, their minds grow
liker; just as the philosopher discerns the similarity of boy and girl, until the
girl is marched away to the nursery." Of course, if the ways of man and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">lxii</a></span>
maid in society ever grew to be exactly alike, comedy would die of inanition.
Consequently, though I say that comedy requires for the sexes equality of
social privilege, I do not mean identity. The <i>synalœpha</i> of the sexes&mdash;such
as some extremists, political and pedagogical, project&mdash;would just as surely
destroy comedy as in former days the inequality of the sexes dwarfed it. The
sentimental and romantic give-and-take is as essential to society as the intellectual,
and as essential to comedy as to society.</p>

<h3>8. The Dramatic Contribution of the Older Morals</h3>

<p>Before discussing the period of transition upon which comedy now enters,
it will be advantageous to determine, if possible, what contributions to the
methods of comedy should be credited distinctively to this moral or moral
interlude during the years that preceded the change, that is, from 1380 to
1520. Certainly not the introduction of the separate play, as is frequently
supposed, nor the substitution of immediate and familiar interests for those
that were remote, nor of the invented plot for the traditional, and the significant
for the spectacular. Though some of these features distinguish the
evolution of the allegorical play, one and another of them is also to be recognized
at as early a period, or earlier, in those forms of the drama, kindred
and unrelated, that I have already described,&mdash;the miracle, the saint's play, the
farce, and the secular festival play. I should say that, so far as the materials of
drama are concerned, the advances peculiar to the allegorical play were, from
the use of the scriptural <i>dramatis persona</i>, frequently instrumental and therefore
wooden, to the use of the dynamic; and from the historical or traditional individual
to the representative of a type. These are substitutions important to
our subject, for, that the individual should come to the front is, as ten Brink
has well said, a characteristic of tragedy, whereas in comedy it is the typical
that is emphasized, to the end that in an example which is typical the follies
of the age may be liberally, and at the same time impersonally, embodied and
chastised. By virtue of its didactic purpose and its allegorical form, moreover,
the moral play must ascribe to its <i>dramatis personæ</i> adequate motives of
action. It therefore must and does make an attempt, even though rude, at
the preservation of psychological probability in the analysis and development
of these motives. Once the dramatic person has been labelled with the name
of a quality, not as appraised from without and denoted by a patronymic
common to dozens beside himself, but from within and specified by his ethonymic
(if I may coin the word), he is no longer a chance acquaintance of the
dramatist or the public, but the representative of an ethical family. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">lxiii</a></span>
moral play the characters stand for or against some convention,&mdash;educational,
ethical, political, religious,&mdash;that is to say, social in the broadest sense. With
the advent of such characters, therefore, the social drama receives an impulse.
Its hero serves to justify or to satirize an institution; for that end he exists.
And therefore in the handling of motives the moral makes a genuine advance
in the direction of comedy, both critical and ideal.</p>

<p>We notice next that the author of this kind of drama finds it necessary to
devise situations for exploiting the idiosyncrasies of his principal characters;
and that, even though the characters be disguised as abstractions, the friction
of what is dynamic with what is real results in something vivid and concrete.
I do not mean to say that the dramatist has learned how to develop character,
but how to display or manifest it. Skill in the portrayal of character in
process of growth came but slowly, and with the passage of the allegorical play
into the drama of real life. As to the portrayal of motives and emotions in
their complexity, that is an art much more refined, to which the writers of the
moral never attained, even though they enriched their abstractions with borrowings
from theologians, philosophers, and poets, for in dealing with abstractions
at all they were dealing with life at second hand. Indeed, complex characters
can hardly be found in English drama before the various tentative dramatic
species had merged themselves in the polytypic plays with which
comedy, properly so called, made its appearance. The allegorical dramatists
found also, like the writers of the later miracle and farce, that critical situations
demanded plain language and unsophisticated manners; and if, in these respects,
the realism of the moral excels that of the earlier miracle, it is perhaps because
of the superior dynamic quality of the moral <i>dramatis persona</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Courthope and other writers on the drama have conjectured that the
improvement characteristic of the allegorical playwright was one to which he
was driven of necessity, namely, the introduction, and consequently the invention,
of a continuous plot. But there was nothing new in the invention of
plot. The novelty, if any, was in the distinctively comic nature of the plot-movement
most suitable to the purpose of this kind of drama. In tragedy,
the movement must be economic of its ups and downs: once headed downward,
it must plunge, with but one or two vain recovers, to the abyss. In
comedy, on the other hand, though the movement is ultimately upward, the
crises are more numerous; the oftener the individual stumbles without breaking
his neck, and the more varied his discomfitures, so long as they are temporary,
the better does he enjoy his ease in the cool of the day. Tragic
effects may be intense and longer drawn out, but they must be few; in
comedy, the effects are many, sudden, fleeting, kaleidoscopic. You can enjoy
a long, delicious shudder, but not a long-spun joke, or a joke frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">lxiv</a></span>
repeated, or many jokes of the same kind. Hence the peculiar movement of
the plot in comedy. Now, the novelty of the plot in the moral play, lay in
the fact that the movement was of this oscillating, upward kind,&mdash;a kind
unknown as a rule to the miracle, whose conditions were less fluid, and to the
farce, which was too shallow and superficial. The heart of the 'moral'
hero was a battleground; as in comedy, the interest was in the vicissitudes of
the conflict and the certainty of peace. Though the purpose of the moral
play was didactic and reformatory, its doctrine was optimistic and its end to
encourage; and one of the distinctive contributions of the moral play to the
English comedy was the movement suitable to these conditions, not the introduction
of a continuous or connected plot. When Mr. Courthope further
speaks of the moral plays as if they were the sole link of connection between
the later miracle plays and the regular drama, and implies that the "morality"
was unique in its introduction of a leading personage, who may be called the
hero of the play, he is attributing to it qualities that existed in contemporary
species of the dramatic kind. As to the statement that the moral play arose,
as if a new kind of play, from some modification of the miracle play, on the
one hand by secular and comic interests, and on the other by allegorical
motives and materials, I think that sufficient has been elsewhere said in this
article to show that secular and comic interests existed in the miracle play without
altering its essence, both before and after the moral had come into prominence,
and that allegorical motives and materials had developed themselves into
the moral pageant and play before the miracle was visibly affected by them.</p>

<h3>9. The Period of Transition: Farce and Romantic Interlude</h3>

<p>The period of experimentation or transition, which may be said to extend
from 1520 to 1553, is characterized especially by the gradual abandonment
of allegorical machinery and abstract material. The forward movement is,
of course, primarily due to the change from the mediæval attitude of mind to
that of the renaissance, from artificial thought whose medium, the symbol, succeeded
in concealing more than it expressed, to experience. Of the social and
political conditions which prepared the way for the transition so far as English
comedy is concerned or that shaped comedy once on its way, I cannot here
speak, but the following would appear among purely literary antecedents:
First, the French <i>sotties</i> and <i>farces</i>, the technical and satirical qualities of
which were a stimulus to invention, not only in England, but in Italy and
Germany; second, the <i>disputations</i> and <i>debats</i>, veritable whetstones of wit
and a polish of words <i>ad unguem;</i> third, the collateral development of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">lxv</a></span>
farce interlude in England, composed in Latin and English, probably also in
Norman French, but generally spontaneous, and wholly unforced; fourth,
the adaptation to dramatic and satirical purposes of <i>contes</i>, <i>fabliaux</i>, <i>novelle</i>,
and their English translations and congeners,&mdash;more especially the Chaucerian
episode with its concrete characters and contemporary manners; fifth, the
movement of native romance urged during the fifteenth and earlier sixteenth
centuries by contact with Spanish and Italian ideals and their fictions of
character, adventure, and intrigue; sixth, the discipline of Plautine and Terentian
models, and of the Latin and vernacular comedies which imitated
them, as well as of the Latin school plays which flourished in Holland and
Germany during the latter half of the fifteenth century; and seventh, the
examples set by Kirchmayer and other German controversialists in the
attempted adaptation of the moral play to historical or quasi-historical conditions
with a view to satirical ends.</p>

<p>The plays that call for consideration in this section and the next may be
classified roughly as farces, romantic interludes, school interludes, and controversial
morals. Each of these kinds reaches a culmination conformable to its
nature, within the limits that I have chosen for the period; and each has its own
place in the history of comedy. For it must not be supposed that, because
a pastoral farce like the <i>Mak</i> did not develop into independent existence, or
because moral interludes gradually exhausted their career towards the end of
the sixteenth century, such species had no influence in maturing English
comedy. The peculiar quality and charm of our comedy is that, deriving
from sources not only distinct, but remote in literary habitat,&mdash;scriptural,
allegorical, farcical, pastoral, romantic, classical, historical, or purely native
and social,&mdash;it has not dissipated itself in a thousand streamlets, but has
carried down deposits from each tributary at its best. In <i>Love's Labor's
Lost</i>, <i>Two Angry Women</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>, <i>Every Man
in His Humour</i>, we find, as in a miner's pan, 'colours' from vastly different
soils.</p>

<p>Of the indebtedness of comedy to the parody of religious festivals I have
already spoken, and I have little doubt that at later periods English comedy
continued to draw devices, if not inspiration, from performances whose occasion
was a revolt against the straitness of religion. One, at least, of the
interludes of John Heywood is closely similar to the French <i>Farce de Pernet</i>,
and that such farces were, in motive, first a gloss upon the lessons of the divine
service, then a diversion, and finally a factor in the extra-ecclesiastical Feast of
Fools, any reader of Petit de Julleville will readily concede. It is impossible
that the comic features and comic characters of the farces acted by the <i>clercs
de la Basoche</i>, such as that of the immortal <i>Maître Pathelin</i>, should not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">lxvi</a></span>
affected the dramatic invention of contemporary and succeeding Englishmen,
conversant as many of them were with the literature and society of France.
And a like effect might naturally be expected to have been exercised by the
<i>sotties</i> of the contemporary <i>enfants sans souci</i>; for, through the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, drama of that kind convulsed the sides of merrymakers
south of the Channel. Such were the occasion and motive of farces and
<i>sotties</i>. So far as they employed the plot of domestic intrigue for their purposes
of satire, I have little doubt that they drew freely upon the Latin elegiac
comedies of which I have already spoken as the favourite dramatic species of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The <i>Farce de Pernet</i> has connection
with more than one of those imitations of Terentian intrigue. It has, also,
like many of its kind and of elegiac comedies as well, a kinship with one and
another popular tale. The church, then, seems to have furnished the opportunity
for these farces, and for some as an object of satire the motive; the
<i>contes</i> and <i>fabliaux</i> of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries furnished
much of the material; Latin comedy, its mediæval and renaissance
successors, cannot have failed to influence the form.</p>

<p>It will be, of course, recalled that as early as the <i>Mak</i> of the Towneley
plays, a farce which is not unworthy of comparison with <i>Maître Pathelin</i>,
the English <i>Interludium de Clerico et Puella</i>, probably of the thirteenth century,
also indicated an acquaintance with the technique of the farce species.
Undoubtedly such interludes were a common feature at entertainments of various
kinds, and had matured in the ordinary course into fixed form. But they
were frequently extemporaneous, were written for fleeting occasions, and
might readily be lost. I am inclined therefore, to look upon the dramatized
anecdotes assigned to Heywood as lucky survivals of a form which, since it
had been long cultivated both in England and France, may have attained to
a degree of excellence before he took it up. The resemblance of these farces
to the French is often such that, as M. Jusserand says, one cannot but question
whether Heywood had not some of the old French dramas of the type in
his hands. Since Mr. Pollard has discussed the question in this volume, it is
unnecessary for me to pursue it farther. In any case, it is to the honour of
Heywood that he brought to focus the characteristic qualities of the Chaucerian
episode, the farce and the dramatic debate. "This I write," says he,
"not to teach, but to touch." In his work, accordingly, we find narratives
of single and independent interest, if not exactly plot, and an adaptation of
that which is abstract to purposes of amusement. We find characters with
motive, and sometimes personality, contemporary manners, witty dialogue,
satire; and in at least the <i>Play of Love</i>, an adumbration of the sentimental,
dare we say romantic, possibilities of comedy, to be realized when it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">lxvii</a></span>
have thrown allegory and scholasticism to the winds. The Laundress in the
<i>Wether</i> envisages fleetingly the straits of life and the recompense; and in the
<i>Play of Love</i>, the personification of various phases of that passion is a kind of
glass through which we darkly divine the motives of many later comedies.
There is, however, with the single exception of the Vice's trick in <i>Love</i>, no
action which can be called dramatic in Heywood's undoubted plays; for, as
Mr. Pollard reminds us, the <i>Pardoner</i> and <i>Johan</i>, although they avail themselves
of "business" in order to develop a plot, have not the significance of
comedy proper.</p>

<p>To understand the nature of the movements that follow we must recur,
though with the utmost brevity, to the history of later Latin comedy. The
comic recitals of the twelfth century and thereabout were succeeded by the
comedy of the Italian humanists, still in Latin, but dramatic in form and apparently
in intent, which, though it availed itself, like the elegiac school, of the
outworn situations and devices of scabrous amours, contributed considerably to
the enrichment of the romantic strain by the passion with which it invested its
material, sometimes, also, to the cause of realism by its unconscious, though
often repulsive, accuracy of detail. Although Plautus is to some extent cultivated,
the Terentian model was still the favourite with youthful imitators until
study of the older poet was revived by the recovery of the twelve lost plays and
their introduction to Roman circles in 1427. The <i>Philologia</i> of Petrarch's
earlier years is accordingly fashioned in the style of Terence, and is even
reported, for it is unfortunately lost, to have surpassed its classical forbears.
Written about 1331, it was the first product of the new dramatic school,
and was succeeded by a numerous train of ambitious effusions,&mdash;university
plays we might call most of them,&mdash;a few witty, some sentimental, many
libidinous, all very young, and still all, or nearly all, cleverly and regularly
constructed. It concerns us here but to mention the <i>Paulus</i> of Vergerio,
which Creizenach dates 1370, Aretino's <i>Poliscene</i>, about 1390, Alberti's
<i>Philodoxeos</i>, 1418, Ugolino's <i>Philogena</i>, some time before 1437, and Piccolomini's
<i>Crisis</i>, 1444.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Of these erotic comedies,&mdash;pornographic were perhaps
a more fitting term,&mdash;the most popular seems to have been the <i>Philogena</i>;
the most eminent, according to Creizenach (but I don't see why), the <i>Crisis</i>.
The <i>Paulus</i> pretends to aim at the improvement of youth; one might for a
moment imagine that it was intended to be a prodigal son play. But in none
of these plays is there either punishment or repentance. In fact the unaffected
verve with which they display the wantonness of life is not the least of their
contributions to comedy. The <i>Poliscene</i> is notable for its modernity of manners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">lxviii</a></span>and of morals. The sole instance among these plays, so far as I can
ascertain, of noble sentiment and harmless plot is the <i>Philodoxeos</i>. The use
of abstract names for the characters lends it, indeed, somewhat the appearance
of a moral interlude.</p>

<p>Of much greater value, however, in the history of the acted drama, and
of closer bearing upon the English comedy, were the representations of Plautus
and Terence, first in the Latin and ultimately in the vernacular, which marked
the last quarter of the fifteenth century in the courts of northern Italy. These
in turn were but stepping-stones towards such dramatic dialogues as the <i>Timone</i>
of Bojardo, 1494, and the still more significant experiments of Ariosto and
Bibbiena&mdash;the first romantic comedies in prose and in the native tongue.
The authors of the <i>Suppositi</i> (acted in 1509) and the <i>Calandria</i> (written in
1508, but not presented till six years later) derive much from Roman
sources, but in general these comedies and their like were original. Their
influence upon our own plays of romantic intrigue will presently appear.
So, likewise, will that of a Spanish work, of even earlier date, the dramatic
novel of <i>Calisto and Melibœa</i>; for this tragic production of Cota and De
Rojas is the source of our first English romantic drama. The connection
between other forms of Italian drama, the <i>Commedia dell'arte</i>, the pastoral
drama, etc., and the later stage in western Europe has been ably discussed by
Klein, Moland, Symonds, and Ward; and to them I must refer the reader
of this more summary account.</p>

<p>The decade that saw the first of Heywood's virile plays was probably
that which welcomed to England the ebullient, un-English passions of a dramatic
species destined to develop the native stock in a far different manner.
"A new commodye in englyshe, in maner of an enterlude," ordinarily called
<i>Calisto and Melibœa</i>, is the earliest romantic play of intrigue in our language.
It was "caused to be printed" by that excellent promoter of the dramatic
art, John Rastell, about 1530, and was written&mdash;perhaps by him&mdash;not long
before. The appellation "commodye" had been used during the same decade
with reference to the English translation of the <i>Andria</i> (about 1520-29);
it is here used for the first time on the title-page of an English play. And this
interesting interlude may, indeed, well be called both English and comedy;
for though it derives from romance sources (the Spanish dramatic composition
by Fernando de Rojas, before 1500), and is affected by the Italian, it does
not follow exactly the plot of its original; and though it is "reduced to the
proportions of an interlude," it treats of an idea not farcical, but significant,
and it develops the motives of real characters, by way of action, passion, and
intrigue, to a happy conclusion within the realm of convention and common
sense. It is, indeed, a comedy, perhaps our first well-rounded comedy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">lxix</a></span>
though in miniature. The <i>Secunda Pastorum</i> it excels in singleness of aim;
the <i>Pardoner and Frere</i> and the <i>Johan</i>, in meaning for life. It excels all
preceding interludes in the fulfilment of the purpose, now for the first time
announced in English drama, "to shew and to describe as well the bewte
and good propertes of women as theyr vyces and evyll condicions." For
the first time since plays became secular, women are introduced, not as the
objects of scurrility and ridicule, but as dramatic material of an æsthetic,
moral, and intellectual value equal to that of men. What the author of <i>Johan</i>
did for the amusing and real action desirable in a comedy, the author of this
play did for vital characterization and passion. Melibœa is the first heroine
of our romantic comedy; she is so fair that for her lover there is "no such
sovereign in heaven, though she be in earth." She is, if the play was written
before the <i>Play of Love</i>, our earliest heroine "loved, not loving." She is a
woman and pitiful and to be wooed; frail and repentant; but then indignant
and not to be won. Calisto is, likewise, our first lover in despair. This
element of woman worship&mdash;not worship of the Blessed Virgin or traditional
interest in the Magdalene or any other saint&mdash;is no slight contribution to the
material of comedy. The intrigue of the play,&mdash;the foils of character and
action, the go-betweens, the plot within plot introduced by Celestina, her
realistic account of Sempronio's character, her device of the "girdle," the mysterious
agency of the dream,&mdash;no better indication of romantic tendency can
be detected until we reach Redford's play of <i>Wit and Science</i>, of which presently.
But first, and that we may keep in mind the parallelism of dramatic
tendencies in this momentous first half of the sixteenth century, let us turn to
another stream, that of the school interludes and the classical influence.</p>

<h3>10. The Period of Transition: School Interlude and Controversial Moral</h3>

<p>During the fifteenth century, and the early sixteenth, influences of importance
to English comedy proceed not from the literature of Italy and Spain alone.
In northern Europe additions most significant to the history of the type were
making. To the crop of French <i>sotties</i>, <i>moralités</i>, and <i>farces</i> I have already
referred. The German Reuchlin in 1498 put forth a roaring Latin comedy
called the <i>Henno</i>, which, in modern Terentian style, embodied the chicaneries
of Pathelin. About the same time the Germans began to make the acquaintance,
through translations in their own tongue, of highly flavoured
Italian Latin plays like the <i>Poliscene</i> and the <i>Philogenia;</i> while those of them
who cared not for such things were favoured with a recrudescence of the
Christian Terence school. In 1507 the young humanist, Kilian Reuter, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">lxx</a></span>
imitation of the nun of Gandersheim, produced in Latin his pious comedy
depicting the passion of St. Dorothea. In Holland, meanwhile, were
springing into existence the Latin prototypes of more than one of our own
didactic interludes; for in the <i>comedia sacra</i> the attempt was made to combine
the intrigue of the Italian university play with the moral of the prodigal
son and the technique of the Terentian drama. The more important of these
plays of the prodigal son, in respect of influence upon English comedy, are
the <i>Asotus</i> of Macropedius, written before 1529, and his <i>Rebelles</i>, 1535, the
<i>Acolastus</i> of Gnapheus, 1529, and the <i>Studentes</i> of Stymmelius, 1549. The
most dramatic of them are the second and third as mentioned. The <i>Acolastus</i>,
indeed, translated into English by Palsgrave in 1540, exerted a long-enduring
influence upon our drama. To the same period belong also a species of biblical
comedies dealing with heroes, like the <i>Joseph</i> of the Dutch Jesuit, Crocus,
1535, and the <i>Susanna</i>, <i>Judith</i>, <i>Eli</i>, <i>Ruth</i>, <i>Job</i>, <i>Solomon</i>, <i>Goliath</i>, etc.,
of Macropedius, the Swiss Sixt Birck, and others; and another kind of play
that occupied itself with prototypes of the Roman Antichrist,&mdash;Haman,
Judas, and the like. The former may be called the idyllic or heroic miracle,
the latter the polemic. And of the latter the most influential development
was the controversial interlude, <i>Pammachius</i>, written by the German Protestant
Naogeorgos (Kirchmayer) and dedicated to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
By 1545 this play, in which the Pope figures as the Antichrist, had not only
been acted at Cambridge in the original, but translated into English by our
own John Bale; and, as we shall presently see, it was, somewhere between
1540 and 1548, imitated by him in one of the most vigorous of our controversial
dramas.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Of the cultivation of the drama in Latin in England I have already made
mention in treating of the saints' plays and the Terentian drama of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries. Other indications of a Latin drama occur, although
infrequently. William Fitzstephen, who speaks of the <i>ludus</i> given by Geoffrey's
boys at Dunstable, tells us, also, that it was customary on feast days
for masters of schools to hold festival meetings in the churches, when the
pupils contested, not only in disputations, but also with Fescennine license in
satirical verses touching "the faults of school-fellows or perhaps of greater
people"; a practice which could only with difficulty escape development
into a rude Aristophanic comedy. We have mention also of perquisites for a
<i>comœdia</i> in one of the Cambridge colleges as early as 1386, evidently of the
Latin type, and of the presentation of a goodly comedy of Plautus at court in
1520. Between 1522 and 1532 the Master of St. Paul's produced a Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">lxxi</a></span>school drama of <i>Dido</i> before Wolsey, and according to Collier's supposition,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
the same John Ritwyse was the author of the satiric interlude, in Latin and
French, of Luther and his wife, which was acted for the delectation of the
not yet reformed Henry and his foreign guests in 1527. Of the nature of
this play, unfortunately lost, some conception may be gathered from the still surviving
list of its characters (allegorical, religious, and contemporary), from the
analogous <i>Ludus ludentem Luderum ludens</i>, 1530, and the somewhat more recent
and most scurrilous <i>Monachopornomachia</i>, both by Germans. Before 1530
and apparently with a view to acting, the <i>Andria</i> had been turned into English,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and by 1535 at least two Latin comedies of moral-mythological character
had been written by Artour of Cambridge, and one, the <i>Piscator</i>, by Hoker
of Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> We have word of a dramatic pageant in English and Latin to
which Udall contributed in 1532; in 1534 he issued a book of selections
entitled <i>Flowers of Terence</i>. In 1540 Palsgrave had introduced the prodigal
son drama from Germany; and by 1545 Bale had followed suit with a
Latin play of Antichrist. During the same period Udall was producing his
<i>plures comœdiæ</i>, now lost, and that other schoolmaster-dramatist, Radcliffe
of Hitchin, was writing <i>spectacula simul jucunda et honesta</i> for his boys
to present,&mdash;heroic miracles of the type affected by Macropedius, and a
romantic comedy of <i>Griselda</i>, probably all in Latin, but unfortunately all
vanished.</p>

<p>The importance of the English school drama has been well presented by
Professor Herford and Dr. Ward, but there is something in the name that
leads the ordinary reader to underrate the <i>genus</i>. A word or so by way
of classification may be of assistance. These interludes fall naturally into
four kinds. Those that ridicule folly, vain pretension, and conceit, or
Mirth plays,&mdash;plays after the model of Plautus, mock-heroic, or purely
diverting, like the <i>Thersytes</i>. Those that are pedagogical in tendency,
directed against idleness and ignorance, or Wit plays. They began with
Rastell's <i>Four Elements</i>, and reached their highest mark in the <i>Contract
between Witt and Wisdome</i>. Those that portray the conflict with the excesses
and lusts of the flesh, or Youth plays. They consist of such productions
as <i>Mankynd</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Hyckescorner</i>, and reach their climax, about
1554, in the <i>Interlude of Youth</i>. The school drama includes, in the last
place, a series corrective of parental indulgence and filial disobedience, aptly
called Prodigal Son plays. These are patterned upon Terence, but follow the
manner of Dutch school plays like the <i>Acolastus</i> or of the still earlier French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">lxxii</a></span>
<i>moralités</i>, <i>Bien-Avisé et Mal-Avisé</i>, <i>L'Homme pêcheur</i>, and <i>Les Enfants de
Maintenant</i>. They make more or less use of the scriptural motif and are
sometimes tragical. In the period under consideration their best representatives
are the <i>Nice Wanton</i> and the <i>Disobedient Child</i>. From the point of view of
comedy the first of these kinds, the Mirth play, occupies a place by itself; for,
though it may sometimes intend to teach, it always aims at, and achieves,
laughter. To the three remaining kinds, we must for convenience, join,
however, another which, though not of the school species, is primarily
didactic,&mdash;I mean the controversial interlude. This includes Bale's <i>King
Johan</i>, Wever's <i>Lusty Juventus</i>, and the <i>Respublica</i>.</p>

<p>In the Mirth play, <i>Thersytes</i>, the influence of Plautus is evident,&mdash;a school
play, to be sure, but written with a view to amusement or rollicking satire
rather than instruction. Acted in 1537, this "enterlude" has for its hero a
"ruffler forth of the Greke lande" whose "crakying" stands half-way between
the classical Pyrgopolinices and Thraso and the modern Roister Doister.
For all its academic flavour, the burlesque is coarse and crude, but still
genuinely humorous. It deserves notice, in especial, for the variety of its
contents, chivalric, romantic, popular, scriptural as well as Greek and Latin;
also for its artistic exhibition of the braggart,&mdash;the leisurely proceeding of
his discomfiture, the subordination of other characters to that end; and for
its mastery of technical devices,&mdash;concealment, magic, the play upon the
word, and that hunting of the word and letter which was so soon to drive
conversation out of its wits. As an interlude of foreign origin, the <i>Thersytes</i>
has a place in the development of the comic element somewhat analogous
to that of the <i>Calisto</i> in the development of the romantic. As far as the
quality of mirth is concerned it might be classed with <i>Roister Doister</i> and <i>Jacke
Jugeler</i>; but those plays are much more highly developed in form and spirit,
and must be reserved for consideration with the polytypic, and early regular,
comedy.</p>

<p>The remaining classes of interlude are manifestly didactic; those of Wit
and Youth derive, however, more directly from native sources, while those
of the Prodigal Son have close affiliation with the Christian Terence of the
continental humanists.</p>

<p>Redford's <i>Wyt and Science</i>, composed probably between 1541 and 1547,
is, in form and intent, like <i>Lusty Juventus</i> and other survivals of the moral
interlude. It differs, however, in company with the <i>Four Elements</i> and
other Wit plays, in substituting a scientific for a religious purpose; and it
adds a feature not to be found in earlier kinds of moral, a chivalrous ideal
of love and adventure, academic, to be sure, but unmistakable. This appears
in the wooing of Lady Science by Wyt, and his encounter with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">lxxiii</a></span>
tyrant or fiend Tediousness "for my dere hartes sake to wynne my spurres;"
in the hero's inconstancy, defeat, and subsequent success, and in the dramatic
employment of romantic instruments and tokens, such as the magic glass
and the sword of comfort; also in the love songs. All of these and
similar features of which the sources are not entirely continental make
for the development of a romantic and humanistic drama. It may be
worth noticing, moreover, that the fiend of the play is neither Vice nor
Devil. He seems to be a cross between the Devil of the miracles and
a monster of native as well as scriptural ancestry (an early draft of Giant
Despair), who figures in a modernization of this play, <i>The Marriage of
Witte and Science</i>. In chronological sequence the next of the Wit plays
is the <i>Contract of a Marrige betweene Wit and Wisdome</i> (not <i>Wit and
Science</i>, as Professor Brandl has it). This was probably written about
the same time as the <i>Lusty Juventus</i>. The mention of the King's most
"royal majestie" and the appearance of the Vice Idleness as a priest would
point to a date earlier than 1553, while the resemblance to Redford's play,
though by no means close, indicates posteriority to that much cruder production.
The division into acts and scenes is, on the other hand, less elaborate
than that obtaining in the latest play of this series, <i>The Marriage of Witte
and Science</i>. The <i>Contract</i> is altogether the most meritorious of those academic
predecessors of the drama of the Prodigal Son which introduce the indulgent
mother as a motive force. While the conception is formal and didactic,
the action avails itself, like Redford's play, of the romantic element involved
in the perilous adventure for love. The <i>Contract</i>, moreover, startles the
sober atmosphere of the moral interlude by a rapidity of movement, a combination
of plots major and minor, a diversity of subordinate characters and
incidents altogether unprecedented. The racy and natural wit, the equivoque,
the actual, even if vulgar, humanity of the scenes from low life,
and the skill with which the Mother Bees, the Dols and Lobs, Snatches
and Catches, the Constable, and the thoroughly rustic Vice with his actual
resemblance to Diccon the Bedlem, are dovetailed into the action,&mdash;these
properties make this a very commendable predecessor, not only of <i>Gammer
Gurton</i>, but of certain plays of Dekker and Jonson where similar features
obtain. With the <i>Contract</i>, the interlude of this kind attains its climax.
<i>The Marriage of Witte and Science</i>, which is a revision of Redford's play
of similar name, must also be mentioned here, although it is a postliminious
specimen of the type. Not licensed until 1569-70, and, according to
Fleay, acted as <i>Wit and Will</i>, 1567-78,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> it adds nothing vital to the plot
or characters of its model. Still, in literary and dramatic handling, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">lxxiv</a></span>
an example of the perfection to which the moral play could come. Collier,
indeed, has said that it was the first play of its kind regularly divided into
acts and scenes with indication of the same: but that is not true, for the
<i>Respublica</i> of 1553 has five acts and the proper arrangement in scenes;
and so have other plays of 1553 or earlier, though of different kind, like the
<i>Jacob and Esau</i>.</p>

<p>If now we pass to the Youth plays, we shall find in the <i>Interlude of Youth</i>
(about 1554) the culmination of dramatic efforts to portray the sowing of wild
oats,&mdash;efforts avowedly moral in purpose, but with a reminiscent smack of the
lips and a fellow-feeling for the scapegrace. The <i>Interlude of Youth</i> is characterized
neither by the unbridled merriment of the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> type nor by
the depth or pathos of dramas portraying solicitous parents and prodigal sons;
but it paves the way for 'tragical' comedies of this latter class, and is infinitely
more dramatic, because more human, than the pedagogical onslaughts
upon idleness, irksomeness, ignorance, and the like of which we have just
treated. It has, perhaps, not been noticed that the <i>Interlude of Youth</i> holds
about the same relation to <i>Hyckescorner</i> in matter of motive and treatment that
<i>Hyckescorner</i> holds to the <i>Four Elements</i> and <i>Mankynd</i>,&mdash;indeed, a closer
relation, for in many details of character, device, situation, as well as by literal
transference of language, it borrows from <i>Hyckescorner</i>. This as indicating the
descent of the species is in itself interesting. But the present play generally
improves upon all that it derives. In addition, the vivid conversation, shrewd
and waggish wit, local colouring, atmosphere of taverns, dicing, cards, and
worse iniquities, justify, I think, the statement that it is at once the most
realistic, amusing, and graceful specimen of its kind. It is, at any rate, as
artistic as a didactic interlude could permit itself to be.</p>

<p>One cannot consider the so-called Prodigal Son interludes, without observing
that the theme itself supplies an opportunity for the enlargement of dramatic
endeavour. For these productions are directed as much against parental
indulgence as against filial disobedience. The "Preaty Interlude called <i>Nice
Wanton</i>," printed in 1560, was written before the death of Edward VI.
Though it may have derived suggestions from the <i>Rebelles</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of Macropedius,
1535, it is of its own originality and dramatic merit, in my opinion, the best
of its class in English at the time of writing. While it presents a mixture of
scriptural, classical, and moral elements, it is essentially a modern production.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">lxxv</a></span>The allegorical lingers only in the character of Worldly Shame. If this be
eliminated, there remains a play with realistic, romantic, and ideal qualities, an
air of probability, and a plot well conceived and excellently completed.
Iniquity, or Baily errand, is a concrete Vice, working by actual and possible
methods. The unfortunate heroine and the well-contrasted pairs of mothers
and sons are manifest not only by their deeds but by the opinions of those who
know them. The plot, in other words, grows out of the characters; it is
full of incident, and it falls naturally into acts, which have been elaborated in
various and dramatically interesting scenes. The movements, on the one hand
toward a catastrophe, on the other toward the triumph of right living, are conducted
with skilful suspense, surprise, discovery, and revolution, and are well
interwoven. The conversations and songs are racy or sober according to the
conditions; the combination of æsthetic qualities, comic, tragic, and pathetic, is
an agreeable advance upon the inartistic extremes afforded by most of the contemporary
interludes of moral intent. The next of these plays, the "pretie and
mery new interlude called <i>The Disobedient Child</i>, by Thomas Ingeland, late
Student at Cambridge," was acted, Mr. Fleay thinks, before Elizabeth in
March, 1560-61. Though it was not published till 1564, it was certainly,
like the <i>Nice Wanton</i>, written before 1553. The purpose is serious and the
conclusion almost tragic, but the play contributes to the comedy of domestic
satire. If the main characters were but indicated by name, like those below
stairs, Blanche and Long-Tongue, this picturesque and wholly dramatic interlude
would have attracted more notice than has been vouchsafed it. Its literary
merits, verse, poetic feeling and expression, and its natural dialogue entitle it
to high consideration; its decidedly novel dramatic qualities, even though they
bear a general resemblance to the <i>Studentes</i><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of Stymmelius, rank it with the
<i>Nice Wanton</i> as one of the most vigorous of our early representatives of the
dramatic actualities of family life.</p>

<p>For reasons which I have already indicated, the controversial plays of the
period between 1520 and 1553 may be considered here. The first of these
in chronological order is Bale's <i>King Johan</i>, about 1540-47, with later
insertions in the author's hand. Its relation to Lyndsay's satire of the <i>Thrie
Estatis</i> is well known; and Professor Herford<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> has indicated its indebtedness
also to the <i>Pammachius</i> and the Protestant version of the antichrist legend.
It is a dramatic satire on the abuses of the church, its riches, orders, brotherhoods,
confessionals, simony, free thought, mummery (judaistic and pagan),
Latin ritual, hagiolatry, and papal supremacy. Few more excellent embodiments
of the Vice have been preserved than the Sedycyon of this play, who
in every estate of the clergy plays a part, sometimes monk, sometimes nun, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">lxxvi</a></span>
canon, or chapter-house monk, or Sir John, or the parson, or the bishop, or
the friar, or the purgatory priest and every man's wife's desire:&mdash;</p>

<p>In spite of Professor Schelling's<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> recent rejection of <i>King Johan</i> from the
list of chronicle plays, I cannot but agree with Dr. Ward that this moral is
of considerable importance in the history of that species. That it uses history
merely as the cloak for a religio-policical allegory, and that it does not quite
succeed in drawing together the points of fact and fiction in the development
of action and character,&mdash;these defects do not alter its significance as the first
English play to incarnate the political spirit of its age in a form imaginatively
attributed to an earlier period of native history. Although it is not a comedy,
it concerns us here as a drama of critical and satirical intent. It is succeeded
by plays like <i>Lusty Juventus</i> and <i>Respublica</i>, which deal more or less with
political affairs, and interest us because they enliven the controversial by the
introduction of the realistic and comic, and, accordingly, in an age when polemics
was politics, contribute to the improvement of comedy by shaping it
more or less to a medium for the dissemination of practical ideas. Moreover,
though Bale had no disciples in the attempt to construct an historical
protestant drama, he may be said to have prepared the way for a protestant
series of another kind. This is what Professor Herford has well called the
biblical <i>genre</i> drama; it is pedagogical and controversial, and, like the <i>King
Johan</i>, its representatives, also, such as the <i>Darius</i> and <i>Queen Hester</i>, had
their precursors, and probably their models, more or less distant, in the idyllic
or heroic miracle of the Dutch and German humanists.</p>

<p>R. Wever's <i>Lusty Juventus</i>, written about 1550,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> is of the dramatic
kindred of <i>Mankynd</i> and <i>Nature</i>. Its characters are allegorical in name but
concrete in person; and one of them, Abhominable Living, passes, also,
under the appellation of "litle Besse." The conversations are sprightly, and
the songs show considerable lyric power. But the play is a protestant
polemic, and its success must have depended to a large extent upon the bitterness
of the satire against</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">lxxvii</a></span>
<div class="i0">"Holy cardinals, holy popes,</div>
<div class="i0">Holy vestments, holy copes,"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="noin">and various alleged hypocrisies and excesses of the Church of Rome. That
this play had a long life is shown by its insertion, though under the designation
of an interlude with which it had nothing in common,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> as a play within a
play in the tragedy of <i>Sir Thomas More</i> (about 1590). The "merye Enterlude"
<i>Respublica</i>, 1553, a children's Christmas play, sustains somewhat the
same relation to political Catholicism as <i>King Johan</i> to Protestantism&mdash;without
the polemics of dogma. Here, as in the preceding political moral of <i>King
Johan</i>, the Vice is used for a satirical purpose, and is not only the chief
mischief-maker, but, also, the principal representative of the comic rôle. In
this play, the Vice is so highly considered that the author, probably a priest,
multiplies him by four, and, by way of foil, offsets the group with that of the
four Virtues, daughters of God, whose presence in the eleventh Coventry play
and in <i>Mankynd</i> has already been noticed. I don't see how Collier can call
the construction of <i>Respublica</i> ingenious; it is childish, clumsy, and trite.
The humour consists in old-fashioned disguises and <i>aliases</i>, equivoque, misunderstanding,
and abuse. But the character of Avarice, who, with his money
bags, anticipates the Suckdrys and Lucres of later comedy, is well conceived,
the conduct natural, the language simple and colloquial. Of historical interest
is the introduction of Queen Mary as Nemesis; of linguistic, the attempt to
reproduce the dialect of the common people; of dramatic, the division into
acts and scenes, which is to be found in but few other plays of the mid-century,
such as <i>Roister Doister</i>, <i>King Johan</i>, <i>Jacob and Esau</i>, and the <i>Marriage
of Witte and Science</i>.</p>

<h3>11. Polytypic, or Fusion, Plays</h3>

<p>With the plays just mentioned each of the dramatic kinds so far considered
reaches its artistic limit. These kinds, however, during the decades roughly
coincident with the years between 1545 and 1566, enter into combinations,
by virtue of which English comedy is assisted to a still further advance.
The plays that represent this stage of literary history may be called polytypic.
<i>Roister Doister</i> and <i>Jacke Jugeler</i> subordinate the materials of academic interlude
and classical farce to classical regulations. Into the <i>Historie of Jacob
and Esau</i> enter characteristics of miracle play, moral, realistic interlude, and
classical comedy. <i>Gammer Gurton</i> and <i>Tom Tyler</i> (of about the same date)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">lxxviii</a></span>subsume, under the domestic play of low life, native elements of both farce and
moral. <i>Misogonus</i> combines elements of moral interlude and farce with
qualities native and foreign, classical and romantic. These are followed by
the biblical <i>genre</i> drama of <i>Godly Queen Hester</i>, partly political and partly
pedagogical in intent. In the first five of these plays the tendency to teach
is reduced almost to a minimum. In the <i>Misogonus</i> and <i>Hester</i> it is present,
but is counterbalanced by romantic or satirical considerations. When, however,
we reach the <i>Damon and Pythias</i> and <i>The Supposes</i>, the didactic has
disappeared altogether in favour of the truly artistic motive. These plays at
last combine the comic and serious, the real, the romantic, and the ideal.
They are constructive, not primarily critical; in fact, they must be regarded
as our first real comedies.</p>

<p>No play of this division better illustrates the impress of the classical model
upon native material than <i>Roister Doister</i>. This "comedie" or "interlude"
was certainly in existence by 1552; indeed, it has not yet been conclusively
shown that it was not acted as early as 1534 to 1541. In the last
contingency it may have anticipated the <i>Thersytes;</i> but, according to Professor
Flügel's argument,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> it was probably not composed till after 1545.
With the <i>Thersytes</i> it has in common several points of detail, but the essential
resemblance is, of course, in the Plautine personage of the braggart. Like
Heywood before him, Udall aims to produce that which "is comendable
for a man's recreation," but the masterpiece of Udall has the advantage of
Heywood's "mery plays," in that its mirth "refuses scurilitie." In
<i>Roister Doister</i>, also, more decidedly than in previous plays, the amusement
proceeds not from the situation alone, but from the organism,&mdash;a plot essentially
and substantially dramatic, because its characters are concrete, purposive,
and interacting. But decided as was Udall's contribution to the art
of comic drama, we must not credit him with producing comedy proper.
The merit of <i>Roister Doister</i> is in its comic intent, its skilful characterization
and contrivance. It is a presentation of humours,&mdash;corrective indeed, but
farcical. It is not significant, constructive, poetic, grounded in the heart as
well as in the head. A contribution to the classical type contemporary with
the preceding, but of a much more farcical and juvenile appearance, is the
"new interlued" named <i>Jacke Jugeler</i>, written not later than 1562 and
perhaps as early as 1553-54 (after the reëstablishment of the Mass and before
the terrifying revival of the sanguinary laws against heretics). It announces
itself as a school drama, and in the prologue purports to have been derived
from the <i>Amphitruo</i> of Plautus. I am inclined to think that the professed
modesty of the author has led critics to undervalue the skill and fidelity of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">lxxix</a></span>
which was not only the best "droll," but also the best dramatic satire produced
in England up to date. Within a narrow compass he has developed a
humorous action quite novel in English comedy, and has introduced us, not
only to the first English double and one of the first English practical jokers,
but, I believe, to our first victim of confused identity. The author is, of
course, following his Plautus, but what could be more ludicrous than the
scene in which Jenkin, uncertain and undesirous of his own acquaintance,
covers himself with ignominy in the effort to discard it. We are led from
interest to interest by means of anticipation, surprise, and the clever repetition
of comic crises. Characters well drawn like Dame Coy and Alison, distinct
like Jacke and Jenkin, suggestive of complexity like Bongrace, were not of
everyday occurrence in the drama of 1553. The language, too, is idiomatic,
and the wit, though vulgar, unforced. But perhaps more significant for our
purpose than any other feature of the play is this, that in spite of its avowed
æsthetic intent (even more outspoken than that of <i>Roister Doister</i>), it is a
subtle attack upon the Roman Catholic Church. This interlude, says the
maker, citing the authority of the classics, is written for the express purpose
of provoking mirth, and for no other purpose: it is "not worth an oyster
shell Except percase it shall fortune to make men laugh well"; but under the
artifice we find a parable of the doctrinal Jacke Jugeler of the day, whose mission
it was to prove that "One man may have two bodies and two faces,
And that one man at one time may be in two places." I do not think that
the satirical character of the play has heretofore been remarked, though the
controversial allusions of the epilogue are, of course, well known. The
innocence of the prologue and the profession of trifles fit for "little boys"
are as shrewd an irony as the dramatic attack upon transubstantiation is a
huge burlesque.</p>

<p>The third of these fusion dramas is <i>The Historie of Jacob and Esau</i>.
Although its title may suggest the dignity of a miracle or the didacticism of
a moral play, it is the reduction of the miracle to modern conditions and of
the moral to concrete and actual characters. This "newe, mery, and wittie
comedie, or enterlude" was licensed in 1557, but its decidedly protestant
character may indicate composition before Mary's accession to the throne.
Collier is quite right in calling it one of the freshest and most effective productions
of the kind to which it belongs. But in classifying it with early
religious plays, because the subject happens to be scriptural, he is as far astray
as Professor Brandl who classes it with plays of the Prodigal Son, because
the nature of the subject suggests a faint resemblance to that species. It is an
attempt at comedy by way of fusion. The plot is in general scriptural, but
it introduces some half-dozen invented characters. The production aims,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">lxxx</a></span>
like a moral interlude, at inculcating the doctrine of predestination; but,
like a classical comedy, it is regularly divided, dramatically constructed, and
equipped with tried and telling comic devices. Proceeding with extreme
care for probability, with elaboration of motive, with due preparation of
interest, enhancement, and suspense, it attains a climax of unusual excellence,
considering the date of its composition. The discovery and <i>denouement</i>
are naturally contrived; and where the author avails himself of the
staples of his trade, the asides, disguises, intrigues, eavesdropping, and the
rest, he does so with the ease of the accustomed dramatist. The play, in
fact, deserves as high esteem as <i>Roister Doister</i> and <i>Gammer Gurton</i>; in
originality and regularity it is their equal, in development of a vital conception
their superior. The language is idiomatic&mdash;of the age and soil; or dignified,
when the mood demands. It is also free from obscenity; but it lacks nothing
in wit on that account, nor the situations in humour. Viewed as a whole,
it is a simple and unaffected picture of English rural life&mdash;the scene with its setting
as well as its figures. And these are coloured from experience, forerunners,
indeed, of many in our better-known comedy: the young squire given
over to the chase, horses and dogs and the horn at break of day (much to the
discomfort of the slumbering environment),&mdash;the careless elder born,&mdash;victim
and butt of his unnatural mother and her wily younger son; the
doting father, duped; the clown; the pert and pretty maid; the aged nurse.
Consider, in addition, the more subtle characteristics of the <i>Jacob and Esau</i>,&mdash;the
family resemblances, the racial policy with its ripe and ruddy upper layer
of morals, the romantic touch, the sometimes genuine pathos, the naïve domestic
revelations, the loves in low life, the unaffected charms of dialogue and
verse,&mdash;and one must acknowledge that this play, no matter what its origin
and name, is at least as indicative of the maturing of English drama as either
of the plays with which I have placed it in comparison.</p>

<p>Of these <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> was the first to gather the threads of
farce, moral interlude, and classical school play into a well-sustained comedy
of rustic life. Mr. Henry Bradley has ingeniously shown that in all probability
it was a Christ's College play, written by William Stevenson during his
fellowship of 1559 to 1560. There may, indeed, be reason for believing
that it was composed as early as the author's first fellowship, 1551-54.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In
this play the unregulated seductions of earlier days are brought under the
curb of the classical manner and form: the native element already evident in
<i>Noah's Flood</i> and the <i>Shepherds' Plays</i>, the <i>Judicium</i>, the <i>Conversion of St.
Paul</i>, the <i>Johan</i>, and the <i>Pardoner</i>, and about this same time in the <i>Contract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">lxxxi</a></span>betweene Wit and Wisdome</i> (parts of which suggest forcibly the manner of
this same Stevenson); the rollicking humour of the Vice turned Bedlem, the
pithy and saline interchange of feminine amenities; the Atellan, sometimes
even Chaucerian, laughter,&mdash;not sensual but animal; the delight in physical
incongruity; the mediæval fondness for the grotesque. If the situations
are farcical, they at any rate hold together; each scene tends towards the
climax of the act, and each act towards the <i>denouement</i>. The characters
are both typical and individual; and though the conception is of less significance
than that of <i>Roister Doister</i>, the execution is an advance because it
smacks less of the academic. <i>Gammer Gurton</i> carries forward the comedy
of mirth, but hardly yet into the rounded comedy of life.</p>

<p>Another "excellent old play," called <i>Tom Tyler and His Wife</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> deserves
to be mentioned in this sequence because it combines characteristics of the farce
in a peculiar fashion with reminiscences of the moral interlude. <i>Tom Tyler</i>
was written probably between 1550 and 1560, and is an admirable portrayal
of matrimonial infelicities in low life, the forerunner of a series of "shrew"
plays, not of the nature of the <i>Taming</i>, but of the <i>Tamer Tamed</i>. The
temporary revolt of the husband, "whose cake was dough," his fleeting
triumph by the ruse of the doughty Tom Taylor, and his lapse into irremediable
servitude, "for wedding and hanging is destinie," these alone would make the
farce worthy of honourable mention. But the dialogue and songs are themselves
of snap, verve, and wit not inferior to the best of that day; and the
coöperation of solemn allegorical figures, such as Destinie and Patience, in the
humorous programme of Desire the Vice, side by side with the three lusty
"shrowes," Typple, Sturdy, and Strife, lends to the farce a mock-moral
appearance which entitles it to a place among these polytypic dramas historically
unique. For it should not be regarded as an example of the moral in transition
from abstract to concrete, but as a conscious and cleverly ironical presentation
of a comic episode from utterly unideal life, under the form, and by the
modes and machinery, of the pious allegorical drama.</p>

<p>For the printing of the next play in this series, the <i>Misogonus</i>, heretofore
accessible only in manuscript at Chatsworth, we are indebted to Professor
Brandl.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This interesting moral comedy was written in 1560, probably by
Thomas Richardes,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> whose name followes the prologue. Brandl points out
certain resemblances to the <i>Acolastus</i> of Gnapheus, printed 1534. The contrast
of the good and wayward sons might likewise be traced to the <i>Studentes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">lxxxii</a></span>
of Stymmelius<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> (1549), but the more evident sources are Terence, the biblical
parable, common experience, and dramatic imagination, Professor Brandl
thinks that the play is connected with <i>The Supposes</i> or its source, but I
must confess that I cannot see the remotest relation. In Mr. Fleay's opinion
this is the earliest English comedy. I suppose because it not only applies a
classical treatment to certain elements of romantic form,&mdash;the Italian scene and
baronial life,&mdash;and of romantic content and method such as the ideal friendship,
the discovery and recognition, but combines therewith a realistic portrayal
of native character, and various technical qualities vital to both the serious
and comic kinds of composition. If, however, the names of the principal
characters had been English, the relation to the moral interlude would at once
be evident. This is a Prodigal Son play of the humanist school, save that it
has supplemented the general characteristics of the Christian Terence and of
Plautus by episodes and minor characters from the native farce. Although it
is not superior in technique to <i>Roister</i> or <i>Gammer Gurton</i>, it is more distinctively
polytypic than either. It is, also, of broader ethical significance. But
this dominant didactic intent renders it less of a comedy than they, and much
less than the <i>Jacob and Esau</i>&mdash;which is as good a representative of the fusion
of dramatic kinds and qualities as the <i>Misogonus</i>, and a better specimen of
workmanship. The simpler characters of the <i>Misogonus</i>, Codrus, poore, but
"trwe and trusty"; the stammering Madge Mumbelcrust, who "coude once
a said our lordyes saw&mdash;saw&mdash;sawter by rote"; and her gossip "Tib, who
has tongue inough for both"; Alison, who knows "what a great thinge an oth
is"; and Sir John, the priest, who knows how to use one,&mdash;these, their ways
and colloquies, are of a piece with Stevenson's work and Heywood's and the
world that their work represents. The conditions and conduct of the leading
<i>dramatis personæ</i> are, on the other hand, more closely akin to the Plautine
and Terentian, to the school of Udall and the humanists. Cacurgus, the
domestic parasite and fool, remotely connected with the Vice, but actually a
counterfeit-simple and wag, is as good a Will Summer as the early comedy
can boast. When Greene made his Nano, Adam, and Slipper, he had in mind
a generation of such creatures. If one could eliminate the sermonizing, there
would remain a plot as satisfactory in unity, in situations, recognitions, crises,
and <i>denouement</i> as any produced during the next twenty years. But, as I
have said above, the moral urgency of the play injures the art. Since the
Prodigal Son is reclaimed, we are, however, justified in ranking the production
among early attempts at English comedy.</p>

<p><i>Godly Queen Hester</i>, published 1561,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> is exactly described as a "newe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">lxxxiii</a></span>
enterlude drawen out of the Holy Scripture." According to Fleay, it is the
latest "scriptural morality" extant to be acted on the English stage.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> But it
is much more than a scriptural morality. Not only by its fusion of biblical
characters, like Assuerus and Hester, with allegorical types, like Pride and the
half-moral, half-native Vice, does the play give evidence of its polytypic
nature, but by its atmosphere, which is charged with local and personal allusions
and ironical references to the economic abuses of the day. In nervous
energy of style and in forthright dramatic movement, the play is an improvement
upon its predecessors; and as a satirical drama of political purpose,
it should have had a numerous progeny. Strange to say, however, this kind
of scriptural satire has had no great success in the field of English drama. Its
bloom, as in Dryden's <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, has been in the by-paths of
poetry. Of a peculiar historical importance is the character of Hardy-dardy.
Mr. Fleay regards him as a domestic fool, and remarks that this interlude
and the <i>Misogonus</i> are the only two early plays in which the Vice is replaced
by such a personage. But neither of these statements is correct, for Hardy-dardy
and Cacurgus do not totally abandon the quality of Vice, and various
other plays yet to be mentioned have characters closely resembling them.
Hardy-dardy is, indeed, a professed jester dressed in a fool's coat; in his
assumption of stupidity and his proffer of service to Aman, he resembles
Slipper in Greene's <i>James the Fourth</i>; and in his shrewd simplicity, repartee,
and indirection he anticipates some of Shakespeare's fools. But he still retains
characteristics of his ancestry. He stands, in conception, half-way between
the minor Vices of the play, Ambition, Adulation, and Pride, to whose
jocosities and deviltries he succeeds,&mdash;for he appears only when they have
departed,&mdash;and the waggish weathercocks of later interludes, Haphazard and
Conditions.</p>

<p>I wish I could have included among the reprints of the present volume
both of the plays next to be mentioned, but limitations of space and other
reasons have forbidden. When Puttenham said that for comedy and interlude
such doings as he had "sene of Maister Edwardes deserved the hyest price,"
and Turberville, that "for poet's pen and passing witte," that poet "could
have no English Peere," I think that they were not greatly exaggerating.
Richard Edwardes' <i>Damon and Pithias</i>, written before 1566, maybe as early
as 1563-65, takes steps significant in literary history. It is not only entirely
free from allegorical elements, and almost from didactic, but it is rich in qualities
of the fusion drama. The subject of a classical story is handled in a
genuinely romantic fashion, although no previous drama of romantic friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">lxxxiv</a></span>
had existed in England. Comic and serious strains flow side by side,
occasionally mingling. A quick satire, dramatic and personal, pervades the
play. The names and scenes may be Syracusan, and types from Latin comedy
may walk the streets, but the life is of the higher and lower classes of
England; and the creatures of literary tradition are elbowed and jostled by
children of the soil. The farcical episodes may be indelicate, but they have
the virility of fact. The plot as a whole is skilfully conducted; while it
proceeds directly to the goal, it encompasses a wider variety of ethical interests,
dramatic motives, and attractions, than that of any previous play. The
relation to an interlude of which we shall presently speak, <i>Like wil to Like</i>,
is beyond doubt. In both a crude psychological pairing and contrasting of
characters may be observed; but in the development of the characters,
<i>Damon and Pithias</i> is decidedly superior. The author calls this "a matter
mixt with myrth and care ... a tragical comedie"; but while he thus
aims at a fusion of the ideal with the commonplace, he makes a close approximation,
always, to probability of incident and character, and so observes the
criterion which he himself enunciates:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"In commedies the greatest skyll is this, lightly to touch</div>
<div class="i0">All thynges to the quicke; and eke to frame each person so</div>
<div class="i0">That by his common talke, you may his nature rightly know."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="noin">In its defects, such as the disregard of time and place, as in its merits, the
<i>Damon and Pithias</i> is a commendable experiment in romantic comedy&mdash;a
contribution worthy of more attention than historians have ordinarily accorded
it. Undoubtedly Edwardes' "much admired play" of <i>Palamon
and Arcite</i>, which the queen witnessed in hall at Christ Church, Oxford,
1566 (and laughed heartily thereat, and thanked "the author for his
pains"), was of the fashion and vogue of the drama which we have discussed,
though it had not the abiding influence.</p>

<p>If it were not for the fact that <i>The Supposes</i> (acted 1566) is a translation
of Ariosto's play of the same title, I should be inclined to say that it was the
first English comedy in every way worthy of the name. It certainly is, for
many reasons, entitled to be called the first comedy in the English tongue. It
is written, not for children, nor to educate, but for grown-ups and solely to delight.
It is done into English, not for the vulgar, but for the more advanced
taste of the translator's own Inn of Court; it has, therefore, qualities to captivate
those who are capable of appreciating high comedy. It is composed, like
its original, in straightforward, sparkling prose. It has, also, the rarest features
of the fusion drama: it combines character and situation, each depending upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">lxxxv</a></span>
the other; it combines wit of intellect with humour of heart and fact, intricate
and varied plot with motive and steady movement, comic but not
farcical incident and language with complications surprising, serious, and
only not hopelessly embarrassing. It conducts a romantic intrigue in a realistic
fashion through a world of actualities. With the blood of the New
Comedy, the Latin Comedy, the Renaissance in its veins, it is far ahead of
its English contemporaries, if not of its time. Without historical apology or
artistic concessions it would act well to-day. Both whimsical and grave, its
ironies are <i>pro bono publico</i>; it is constructive as well as critical, imaginative
as well as actual. Indeed, when one compares Gascoigne's work with the
original and observes the just liberties that he has taken, the Englishing of
sentiment as well as of phrase, one is tempted to say, with Tom Nashe, that
in comedy, as in other fields, this writer first "beat a path to that perfection
which our best poets have aspired to since his departure." He did not contrive
the plot; but no dramatist before him had selected for his audience,
translated, and adapted a play so amusing and varied in interest, so graceful,
simple, and idiomatic in its style. It was said by R. T., in 1615, that Gascoigne
was one of those who first "brake the ice for our quainter poets who
now write, that they may more safely swim through the main ocean of sweet
poesy"&mdash;a remark which would lose much of its force if restricted to the
poet's achievements in satire alone; in the drama of the humanists he excelled his
contemporaries, and in the romantic comedy of intrigue he anticipated those
who, like Greene and Shakespeare,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> adapted the Italian plot to English manners
and the English taste. Nor are these the only claims of Gascoigne to
consideration: <i>The Supposes</i>, as Professor Herford has justly remarked, is the
most Jonsonian of English comedies before Jonson.</p>

<h3>12. Survivals of the Moral Interlude</h3>

<p>Though we must refrain from description, we cannot forbear mention of
a few survivals of the moral interlude, which, though themselves rudimentary,
were not without esteem even in an age when the drama, by combination and
adaptation of its possibilities, was producing other results infinitely superior to
the older strain. These functionless survivals of the moral were the following,
all controversial: <i>Newe Custome</i>, an anti-papist play, perhaps written as early
as 1550-53; <i>Albyon Knight</i>, a political fragment acted between 1560 and
1565; <i>Kyng Daryus</i>, a peculiarly insipid disputation, evidently anti-papist,
printed in 1565; and <i>The Conflict of Conscience</i>, a doctrinal drama by Nathaniel
Woodes, Minister in Norwich, which presents a mixture of individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">lxxxvi</a></span>and even historical characters with abstractions, stands midway between the
allegorical interlude and the drama of concrete experience, displays a commendable
realism in spots, and is a more virile production than the others of
this group. It was not published till 1581, but was probably written soon
after 1563.</p>

<p>Of the decadent stock of morals and interludes, there were, however,
some specimens between the years 1553 and 1578 that exhibited an advance
in quality, if not in kind. Three of these, <i>The Longer thou Livest</i>, <i>All for
Money</i>, and <i>Tide Taryeth no Man</i>, Mr. Fleay<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> lumps together as simple instances
of the survival of the older 'morality' after the introduction of tragedy
and comedy on the models of Seneca and Plautus, and makes the further
statement that none of them teaches us anything as to the historical development
of the drama in England. With the utmost respect for the knowledge
of this most helpful historian, I must say that, as a matter of judgment, none
of these dramas, least of all, <i>Longer thou Livest</i>, should be classed with the
moral plays of mere survival. While the authors of these and similar specimens
did not produce a new kind, they did more than repeat the old. They
revived and enriched the moral interlude by infusion of new strains, and so
produced, by culture, a most interesting group of what may be called variations
of the moral. To this class of morals belong also the <i>Triall of Treasure</i>,
<i>Like wil to Like</i>, and the <i>Life and Repentaunce of Marie Magdalene</i>. It must
be said also that a few moral tragedies of the period, like R. B.'s <i>Apius and
Virginia</i> (about 1563, pr. 1575), and Preston's <i>King Cambises</i> (S. R.
1569-70), have some claim to belong to this group, and that if there were
space they should receive attention for their vital dramatic quality and their
development of the character of the Vice. The Hap-hazard of the former,
far from being, as Dr. Ward has said, "redundant to the action," suggests
the "conspiracies" which Apius adopts, and is the heart of rascality and fun;
he is consequently a Vice of the old type; but he is also the representative
(in accordance with his name and express profession) of the caprice of the
individual and the irony of fortune. He is the Vice, efficient for evil, but in
process of evolution into the inclination or humour of a somewhat later
period of dramatic history: the inclination not immoral but unmoral, the
artistic impersonation of comic extravagance, in accordance with which Every
Man is in his Vice, and every Vice is but a Humour. The Ambidexter
of the latter tragedy plays "with both hands finely" in the main action,
and at the same time serves to provoke the jocosity of those admirably concrete
ruffians, Huf, Ruf, and Snuf, and of the clown of the play. The
<i>Horestes</i>, written by John Pikerynge in 1567, must, although a tragedy, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">lxxxvii</a></span>be mentioned here.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The Vice under his dual designation of Corage and
Revenge is of the weathervane variety; and in realistic and humorous qualities
the play closely resembles the preceding two. They were a noble but
futile effort to bottle the juices of tragedy, classical-historical at that, in the
leathers of moral interlude.</p>

<h3>13. The Movement towards Romantic Comedy</h3>

<p>We may now proceed with the main current of comedy. Between 1570
and 1590 the best plays are coloured by a distinctively romantic element; and
this is noticeable, not only in the productions of the greater authors, Lyly,
Peele, Greene, and the like, elsewhere discussed in this volume, but in
those of minor writers too frequently ignored. As I have already said,
the romantic in life appears to spring from a desire to assert one's independence
and realize the possibilities of the resulting freedom. "Our pent
wills fret And would the world subdue." But since the conditions of life
are largely opposed to the complete fulfilment of our desires, it is the privilege
and function of romance, and of romantic comedy according to its kind, to
idealize the stubborn facts&mdash;the "limits we did not set" in favour of our
ecstatic but still human urgency. This privilege the comedy of romance
exercises sometimes with an eye to nature and probability, and sometimes
with some respect for imaginative possibility, but quite frequently with no
other guide than mere caprice. The subjects of such comedy may be briefly
summarized as passion, heroism, and wonder. Of these the first is manifest
in examples of ideal friendship, its devotion and self-sacrifice; and a play of
such nature we have already considered in the <i>Damon and Pithias</i>. It also
yields the furnishings of love, the resulting obstacles, and the issue; and a
play of this kind we have considered in <i>The Supposes</i>, which is a domestic
comedy of intrigue. Of heroism the possibilities are suggested by the words
travel, adventure, chivalry, war, conquest; those of wonder are as various
as the chances of birth, wealth and fortune, pomp and power, myth and
fable: they are fostered by that which is remote, preternatural, supernatural.</p>

<p>To the romance of wonder, saints' plays, legends, and biblical stories had
purveyed from early times. From 1570 on the narrative of chivalry and adventure,
of which shadowy lineaments had already appeared in one or two
miracle plays and in the interludes of Wit and Science, began to gather to
itself kindred elements of romantic interest, and to occupy the stage with
such plays as <i>Common Conditions</i>, written perhaps between 1572 and 1576,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">lxxxviii</a></span>and <i>Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes</i>, written perhaps as early,&mdash;dramas of love,
fable, and adventure, absolutely free from didactic purpose. At the same
time still another variety of romantic comedy, unhampered by the trammels
of instructive intent, but dealing essentially in domestic intrigue, kept alive the
method of <i>The Supposes</i>. This variety was represented by <i>The Bugbears</i>,
between 1561 and 1584, and <i>The Two Italian Gentlemen</i> (S. R. 1584),
which, based upon Italian models, availed themselves on the one hand of a
burlesque parody of the magical, and on the other of genuine English mirth.
The latter indeed added something of the 'humours' element soon to be
exploited by Porter, Chapman, and Jonson. Beside these dramas, there
sprang into notice a certain half-moral, half-romantic kind of play which,
availing itself of the mould of the interlude, fused therein the materials of the
chivalrous, the magical, and the passionate, and produced certain anomalous
comedies of great popularity between the year 1580 and the end of the
century. The best of these "pleasant and stately morals" are: <i>The Rare
Triumphs of Love and Fortune</i>, <i>The Three Ladies of London</i>, <i>The Three
Lordes and Three Ladies of London</i>.</p>

<p>While Collier thinks that, in point of positive dramatic interest, the <i>Rare
Triumphs of Love and Fortune</i> requires but brief notice, Dr. Ward holds that
the beginnings of romantic comedy were foreshadowed by the play.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> It is,
in fact, both dramatically and historically, one of the most important productions
of its date. It was printed in 1589, but played, perhaps, as early as
1582. Mr. Fleay has assigned it to Kyd, but I do not see sufficient reason
for the attribution; if we must find an author for it, Robert Wilson's claims
might be urged. The <i>Rare Triumphs</i> affords an excellent instance of the
fusion of moral and romance. In the Induction, Love and Fortune dispute
concerning their respective influence in the affairs of mankind. By mutual
agreement the <i>debat</i> seeks its solution in a practical demonstration of the
issues involved. And so we find our intellectual as well as emotional interest
enlisted in the chances of an Italian story of love, adventure, and magic.
Within a moral interlude of classical and mythological origin we discover a
romantic comedy. The influence of the supernatural not merely envelops,
but permeates the whole; the Acts present the destinies of the mortals of the
inner play, the inter-acts the continued intervention of the immortals of the
outer. The spectacular effect is, moreover, heightened by the introduction of
dumb shows, after the fashion of the masque. In dramatic interest proper
few romantic fables of 1582 can compare with the inner story: the love of
Hermione for Fidelia, the duel between Hermione and Fidelia's brother, the
exile of the lover and his retirement to the cave of his unknown father, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">lxxxix</a></span>
hermit Bomelio; Bomelio's attempt to right matters by magic, the destruction
of his necromantic books, his madness, his recovery, and the resolution of
difficulties through the instrumentality of the heroine. Such a fable is anything
but silly and meagre, as Collier would have it, especially when we
consider its conjunction with the humorous and vivid. In the outer play the
clown is Vulcan, at whose call Jupiter mediates, "like an honest man in
the parish," between the disputatious goddesses. In the inner play Penulo
the parasite and Lentulo the clown, though neither of them a Vice, supply the
comic delectations of the rôle. The disguise of Bomelio as physician, his
dialect, his misfortune and raving, are excellently contrived and conducted.
In at least half a dozen particulars one may detect æsthetic possibilities later to
be matured in more than one Shakespearian play: foreshadowings of plot and
principal actors, as in <i>The Tempest</i>; foreshadowings of minor characters like
Dr. Caius, or like the Francis of <i>1 Henry IV</i>. The play is, in brief, refreshing;
the humour, substantial and English; the language, conversational, dramatic,
sometimes in prose and then excellent. The versification, however,
is of that stiffer quality which warrants Mr. Fleay's conjecture of 1582, or
thereabout, as the date of composition.</p>

<p>The attempt to enliven the "old moral" by an infusion of passion and
intrigue, and to parade it in the trappings of romance, across the background of
contemporary English life and manners, is what distinguishes Robert Wilson's
"right excellent and famous Comœdy called the <i>Three Ladies of London</i>,"
printed 1584, and its sequel, <i>The Pleasant and Stately Morall of the Three
Lordes and Three Ladies of London</i>, registered in 1588. Of these plays,
the latter trades in pomp and chivalry; the earlier in something like the
motives of romantic interest. "The acuteness and political subtlety evinced
in several of the scenes of the <i>Three Ladies</i>" have been justly commended by
Collier, who points with careful attention also to "the severity of the author's
satirical touch, his amusing illustrations of manners, his exposure of the tricks
of foreign merchants, and the humour and drollery which he has thrown
into his principal comic personage." This is Simplicity, the fool or clown,
droll, indifferent, honest, and by no means so simple as he appears: a
descendant of the historical Will Summer, a forerunner of the Dogberrys and
Malaprops, and the elder brother of an Honesty of another play, <i>A Knack to
Know a Knave</i>, in which the same author probably had a hand. Standing
over against three belated specimens of the Vice, Simplicity unites the shrewdness,
manners, and humour of that personage&mdash;but in superior quality&mdash;with
the prudence, the penetration, and the conception of honour peculiar to the
professional jester. He also plays a vital part in the main action, and is worthy
to be regarded as one of the best clowns, if not the best, in the history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">xc</a></span>
moral interlude. His forthright utterances in the <i>Three Ladies</i> and his easy
and witty prose in the sequel mark him for a model likely to have influenced
the younger dramatists of the day. The minor plot-interest of the honest
Jew, Gerontus, the rascally Christian, Mercatore, and the Judge, is significant,
not only as the reverse of the conception dramatized in the <i>Jew of
Malta</i> and the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, but as, with one exception, the earliest
elaboration of the motif that was to become prominent in the drama of the
next few years. Qualities romantic and real invest the career of the three
Ladies; and the characterization of the numerous minor personages is both
subtle and suitable to their different classes and interests.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Three Lordes and Ladies</i>, one of the earliest sequels in the
history of English drama, is "more of a moral" than its predecessor and
makes no improvement in plot-structure, it is of importance fully equal. For
what it lacks in passion and romance is more than counterbalanced by technical
qualities&mdash;the blank verse, the fluent prose, the wit of Simplicity and
the pages, the scenic display, the variety of incidents, and the portrayal of
manners. If we consider the definite transition from abstractions to social
and individual traits of character in this play and the preceding,&mdash;the multi-fold
impersonation of worldly wisdom, fraud, and shoddy, one might say
the resolution of the rôle of Vice into its component specialties; the corresponding
offset of all these by ensamples of virtuous living, but still human;
and the attendant <i>troupe</i> of more obvious 'humours,' Simplicity and the
pages, Painful Penury, Diligence, and the rest,&mdash;it will be evident that
these plays of Robert Wilson are the merging of moral interlude in romantic
and social comedy. On this account I cannot agree with Dr. Ward,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> who
says that in construction and conception they mark no advance whatever upon
the older moralities. I think they mark a significant advance. In them the
moral has arrived at a consciousness of the demands of art; and, attempting
to fulfil its possibilities, it acquires body, spirit, and <i>bouquet</i>, even though,
in the moment of fermentation, it bursts the bottle. Still we must remember
that we have now reached a date, 1588-90, by which much of
the best work of Lyly, Marlowe, Peele, and Greene had already been produced,
and we must, therefore, not attribute to Wilson an importance greater
than that of an industrious and inventive contemporary, hospitable to ideas,
but essentially conservative in practice. He is at once "father of interludes,"
as interludes then were regarded, and an intermediary between the interlude
of moral abstractions and the comedy of humours. He appears, also, to have
played so lively a part in the dramatic history of his day that Mr. Fleay is
justified in calling this period by his name; and, therefore, a few further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">xci</a></span>
words concerning him and other plays which he seems to have written
might well be said here, but we must reserve them for another occasion.</p>

<h3>14. Conclusion</h3>

<p>With but one or two exceptions the plays which we have so far passed in
review fail in some respect or other of the plot that makes a comedy. A plot
that is argumentative, that is a ratiocination or <i>exemplum</i> conducted by abstractions,
is not sufficient to constitute comedy, though it may contribute to
its development a unity of interest, a spiritual sequence; nor are sporadic
situations and incidents sufficient, though humorously conceived and executed;
nor glimpses of types, characters or manners, nor hints of passion, nor
satiric speeches and dialogues, though artistically dramatized, true, appropriate,
and witty. None of these constitutes comedy. Comedy demands
action vitalized by a plot that is capable of revealing the social significance of
the individual: an action of sufficient scope and reality to display the spirit of
society in individual types and manners, or in character and sentiment; a
plot sufficiently urgent to interest us, not only in the phenomena, in the concomitants,
of every deed, but in its motive and inherent passion. The comedy
of external life may present, by means of typical individuals and conventional
manners, a reflex of that which is actual, or a criticism of it; and such a
play will be realistic or satirical. The comedy of the inner life, on the
other hand, since it reveals the characteristics of humanity in the heat and
moment of passion, may present a vision of the ideal made concrete; it is
therefore at once interpretative, constructive, and romantic. These two kinds
of comedy are alike in that they display the triumph of freedom when
regulated by common sense, the adjustment of the individual to society. But
as they vary in function and result, so these kinds of comedy differ in the
quality of action which each may present. The play of convention and manners
can use only the externals of action, actions that neither strike deep nor
spring from the depths, for such a play aims to reproduce appearances or
merely to re-create them&mdash;to criticise and correct rather than construct.
The play of character and passion, not the so-called realistic, but idealistic,
selects for presentation actions whose springs are in the inner life; and that is
because it would present men and women as they should be,&mdash;individuals
widening the social, pressing toward the ideal, not by overstepping that
which is conventional, but by informing it with new meaning and pushing
back its limits. Comedy, therefore, is in the plot, and the plot must proceed
from the wisdom essential to a comic view of life: acceptance of the
social environment as it appears to be, because one believes in society as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">xcii</a></span>
should be. The dramatist, his plot and his characters, are the exponents of
common sense and freedom, of the light of life as it is with the sweetness of
life as it may be. Common sense, however, may become prosaic, or liberty
licentious; and it is in preventing such extremes that wit and humour perform
their function. Neither of these can alone make a comedy, but one of
them may sometimes save it. Both should certainly characterize it. But for
the former, the drama of appearances might be caricature, abuse, horse-play,
or homily; but for the latter, romantic comedy would be bathos. No
amount of wit, however, could save a play that did not possess a significant
sequence of material and event. Though the booths of Bartholomew Fair
agitate the diaphragm, they do not constitute comedy. Without plot the
lunges of wit lack point; and as for the plotless play of passion, it ends in
Bedlam, whence all the humour in the world cannot redeem it.</p>

<p>It was a step forward when allegory made way for concrete characters
and manners, and the motives born of social intercourse; a further step when
the dramatist ceased instructing and sought to amuse. But the final step
implied the still rarer ability to create something integral and critical in one,
something that should act what life means, and so unconsciously demonstrate
that it is purposive, and more hopeful and amusing than we thought. Naturally
enough, our earlier comic plots, when they were escaping from the symbolic,
lacked sometimes in significance, and sometimes in sequence. The
fables of <i>Roister Doister</i> and <i>Gammer Gurton</i> mark an advance in technical
construction; but they do not escape the farcical, for their subjects are
trivial. There were likewise many experiments to be made in the materials of
intrigue and passion before <i>Damon and Pithias</i> and <i>The Supposes</i> could fulfil,
even in part, the requirements of significant romance. And when, at last,
the play with a plot had come to its own, it was long before it attained
wisdom to suffuse the appearances of life with their illuminating characteristic,
and imagination to colour the course of characteristic events.</p>

between the play and the mumming or the mute pageant; to the dumb show may be assigned
some of the <i>St. Georges</i> and the pageants of Fabyan, Sebastian, and Botulf, displayed, in 1564, by
the religious gild of Holy Trinity (St. Botolph without Aldersgate). For some conception of
the frequency and vitality of such shows one need only turn to Hone, Stow's <i>Survey</i>, the

<h3>CRITICAL ESSAY</h3>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
<b>Life.</b>&mdash;The first authentic record of John Heywood is one of 6 January,
1515, in Henry VIII.'s Book of Payments, which shows him to have then
been one of the King's singing men, in receipt of a daily wage of eightpence.
According to Bale, who must have known him, he was "civis Londinensis,"
the story that he was born at North Mimms, Hertfordshire, having apparently
arisen from his possession of land in that neighbourhood. Tradition has
sent him to Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke College, Oxford, and there is
nothing improbable in this. In February, 1521, Heywood was granted by the
King an annuity of ten marks, and in 1526, a quarterly payment of the same
sum was made him as a "player of the virginals." He appears to have been
specially attached to the retinue of the Princess Mary, a payment being made
in January, 1537, to his servant for bringing her "regalles" (or hand-organ)
from London to Greenwich, and Heywood himself in March, 1538, receiving
forty shillings for "pleying an interlude with his children" before her.
At Mary's coronation Heywood made her a Latin speech in St. Paul's
Churchyard, and in November, 1558, the Queen granted him some leases in
Yorkshire. On the accession of Elizabeth, Heywood, though he had steered
through the reign of Edward VI. with safety, fled to Malines, and Professor
Ward (in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>) identifies him with the John
Heywood who in 1575 wrote from Malines, "where I have been despoiled
by Spanish and German soldier," thanking Burghley for ordering the payment
to him of some arrears on lands at Romney, and speaking of himself as
an old man of seventy-eight, which would give 1497 as his birth-year. He
is mentioned in a list of refugees in 1577, but by 1587 is spoken of as "dead
and gone." Earlier biographers, it should be noted, following Anthony à
Wood, have placed his death in 1565. Besides his plays Heywood wrote
a <i>Dialogue Conteyning the Number of the Effectuall Prouerbes in the Englishe
Tonge</i>, <i>Six Hundred Epigrams</i>, and a tedious allegory <i>The Spider and
the Flie</i>, printed, with a woodcut of the author, in 1556.</p>

<p><b>Heywood's Place in English Comedy.</b>&mdash;The early history of
English comedy is a record of successive efforts and experiments
apparently leading to no result. The comic scenes in the miracle
plays culminate in the really masterly sheep-stealing plot of the
<i>Secunda Pastorum</i> in the Towneley Cycle; but the step which seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
to us so obvious, the separation of the Pastoral Comedy from its
religious surroundings, was never taken, and the <i>Secunda Pastorum</i>
stands by itself, a solitary masterpiece. In the earlier moralities
there are flashes of humour as in the miracle plays; in the later
moralities we find scenes in which the effort to paint the riotous
course of Youth, though not very amusing to modern readers, is
sufficiently faithful to bring us within sight of a possible comedy
of manners. But the morality-writer was far from entertaining
any conception of comedy as an end in itself. His aim remained
to the last purely didactic. It did not, indeed, occur to him, as it
occurred to didactic writers of a later period, to represent dissipation
as so unattractive as to make it miraculous that it should
attract. He would show it as bitter of digestion, but neither playwright
nor audience were concerned to deny that it was pleasant in
the mouth, and it is improbable that readiness to acquiesce in the
sober moral of a play diminished in the least the applause with which,
we may be sure, any approach to gayety in the tavern scenes would
be attended. After all, though we may sometimes be inclined to
doubt it, audiences both at miracle plays and moralities were human.
To the very real strain imposed on their emotions in the miracle
plays they needed what seem to us these incongruous interludes
of humour by way of dramatic relief, and in the moralities it is
difficult not to believe that the humour supplied the gilding without
which the didactic pill, at a much earlier date, must have been found
nauseating. It remains, however, certain that alike in the miracle
plays, the moralities, and the moral interludes such humour as can be
found is merely incidental, and this is the justification for assigning
to John Heywood the honourable position which he occupies in this
collection of English comedies. As far as we know, he was the
first English dramatist to understand that a play might be constructed
with no other objects than satire and amusement, and if
such epithets were not fortunately a little discredited, we might
dub him on this score the "Father" of English comedy. Paternity,
however, cannot be predicated without some evidence of
offspring, and it would be extremely difficult, I think, to show that
Heywood exercised sufficient influence on any subsequent dramatist
to be reckoned as his literary father. The anonymous author of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
amusing children's play, <i>Thersites</i>, was indeed a kindred spirit, but
there is at least a possibility that this play should be credited to Heywood
himself, and on the subsequent development of comedy his
influence was certainly of the smallest. But to have shown that
comedy was entitled to a separate existence, apart from didactics,
was no small achievement, and to the credit of this demonstration
Heywood is entitled.</p>

<p>In guessing how Heywood came to make this discovery it seems
not unreasonable to lay some stress on the fact that, according to a
tradition which there is no reason to doubt, he was a friend of Sir
Thomas More, while we know that four of his plays were printed
by William Rastell, the son of More's brother-in-law, John Rastell.
More's interest in the drama is attested by the story of his stepping,
on more than one occasion, among the players, when they were performing
before Cardinal Morton, and taking an improvised share in
the dialogue. In the play of <i>Sir Thomas More</i>, written towards the
close of the century, this improvisation is transferred to an interlude
performed during an entertainment at More's own house, and the
introduction of this interlude into the piece, and the ready welcome
which the Chancellor is represented as giving the players, certainly
argue a tradition of a keen interest in the drama on his part. John
Rastell, again, has been credited with the authorship of at least one
of the interludes which he printed, and quite recently some interesting
documents have been discovered, which show him organizing
a performance for which a wooden stage was erected in his own
garden at Finsbury, setting Mrs. Rastell to help a tailor to make
some very gorgeous dresses, and apparently engaging as players the
craftsmen (a certain George Birch, currier, and his friends), who
up to this date were still the customary performers, as distinct from
a separate class of trained actors. Rastell, at this time, and More,
throughout his life, held those views as to church-policy to which
we know that Heywood himself consistently clung. The attitude of
firm belief, with an absolute readiness to satirize abuses, which we
find in Heywood's plays, was exactly characteristic of More, and it
does not seem fanciful to believe that it was partly to the author of
the <i>Utopia</i>, and to the circle of which he was the centre, that Heywood
owed his dramatic development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>

<b>Plays assigned to him: Authorship, Dramatic Development, Literary
Estimate.</b>&mdash;There is the more reason for insisting on Heywood's
place as one of a little circle, interested in playwriting and play-acting,
in that the evidence for his authorship of two of the best of
the six interludes commonly assigned to him is extremely vague.
It is, indeed, very unfortunate that the six plays divide themselves
into a group of four and a group of two, and that whereas the four
plays of the first group are all positively assigned to him in one case
in a contemporary manuscript, said to be in his own writing, in the
others in contemporary printed editions, the two plays of the second
group were both published anonymously, although, like <i>The Play of
Love</i> and <i>The Play of the Wether</i>, they were issued by William Rastell,
and appeared within a few months of these plays to which Heywood's
name is duly attached. In the case of publications of our
own day we should certainly be justified in thinking that the assertion
of his authorship in two cases and the failure to assert it in two
others were intentional and significant. But in the first half of the
sixteenth century there was still much carelessness in these matters,
while the difference is fairly well accounted for by the fact that in
<i>The Play of Love</i> and <i>Play of the Wether</i> Rastell printed the title and
<i>dramatis personæ</i> on a separate leaf, whereas in <i>The Pardoner and the
Frere</i> and <i>Johan Johan</i> there is only a head title. However this may
be, we are bound in the first instance to consider by themselves the
four plays of which Heywood's authorship is beyond dispute.</p>

<p>In approaching these four plays we must prepare ourselves to
judge them relatively to the other work of the very dull period of
English literature at which they were written. To make this claim
for them is to admit that they are imperfect, important historically
rather than absolutely for their own worth; but the admission is
one which no sane critic can avoid, and it is here made with alacrity.
What it gains for Heywood is the recognition that two strongly
marked features of these plays, one of which is now likely to repel,
and the other to weary, most modern readers, in his own day helped
to make them amusing. The repellent feature is, of course, that
humour of filth which, quite as much as his sexual indecencies,
makes some passages both in the <i>Four PP.</i> and <i>The Play of the
Wether</i> disgusting even to readers not consciously squeamish. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
epithet 'beastly' which Pope applied to Skelton is certainly on this
score no less appropriate to Heywood, but it needs no wide acquaintance
with the popular literature of his day to learn that this wretched
stuff was found amusing for its own sake. To suppress this fact,
either by expurgating or by deliberately choosing a less typical play
for the sake of its accidental decency, would be to falsify evidence,
and any such falsification would be grossly unjust to Heywood's
successors. It is only by realizing how low was the conception of
humour in the sixteenth century that we can explain the existence
in the plays of Shakespeare himself of passages which would otherwise
be wholly amazing.</p>

<p>For the other feature in Heywood's plays which now excites
more weariness than interest there is no need to apologize; we
may even confess that our failure to relish it is due to our own
weakness. In Heywood's days one of the chief aims of education
was skill in argument. Men disputed their way to academical
degrees, and the quickest path to reputation was the successful
maintenance against all comers of some hazardous proposition.
Instead of introducing this siege-train of argument into their plays,
modern dramatists have preferred the lighter weapons of verbal
pleasantry and repartee which make what is called "pointed dialogue."
A request from one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> to another
"in this cause to shewe cause reasonable.... Hearyng and
aunswerynge me pacyently" would assuredly empty any theatre of
our own day. But the audience who listened to it in Heywood's
<i>Play of Love</i> no doubt settled themselves in their places with an
anticipation of enjoyment. And we may fairly grant that our
author is not wholly unsuccessful in vivacious argument. For a
lady to compare the suit of an unwelcome lover to an invitation
"to graunte hym my good wyll to stryke of[f] my hed," pleasingly
illustrates the unreasonableness of too great pertinacity on the part
of the rejected. The objection "Howe many have ye known
hang willingly" shatters at a blow the seemingly sound plea that
as the convict suffers more than his hangman, so the rejected lover
is more to be pitied than the most tender-hearted lady who finds
herself obliged to refuse him. The ups and downs of the argument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
are often conducted with ingenuity, and an audience to whom argument
was amusing for its own sake no doubt applauded every point.
Two of Heywood's plays depend almost entirely on their logical
attractions,&mdash;the interlude, left unprinted till its issue by the Percy
Society in 1846, to which has been given as title <i>The Dialogue of
Wit and Folly</i>, and <i>The Play of Love</i> twice printed by Rastell (1533
and 1534) and once by Waley. The former is purely argumentative,
discussing the question as to whether the fool or the sage has
the pleasanter life. The <i>Play of Love</i>, on the other hand, may be
said to have two episodes, the first a monologue of some three hundred
lines in which the Vice, "Neither Loving nor Loved," narrates
his ill-success in an endeavour to conquer the heart of a lady without
losing his own, the second his appearance with a bucketful of
squibs and a false story of a fire at the house of the happy lover's
mistress. The argument in this play is double, "Loving not
Loved" and "Loved not Loving" contending as to which is the
more miserable, and "Both Loved and Loving" and "Neither Loving
nor Loved" as to which is the happier. As each pair appoints
the other as joint arbitrators, it is perhaps more surprising that any
conclusion was reached, than that it should be the rather tame one
that the pains of the first pair and the happiness of the second were
in each case exactly equal.</p>

<p>In connection with these two plays we ought perhaps to allude to
another, very similar in its form, the dialogue of <i>Gentylnes and Nobylyte</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
of which the authorship has often been attributed to Heywood.
This play is certainly printed in John Rastell's types, but in place
of a colophon it has the words "Johannes Rastell fieri fecit," and as
Rastell would probably have written "imprimi fecit" if he had been
alluding merely to its printing, we can hardly doubt that the word
"fieri" refers to performance, if not to composition. With the
evidence we now have that John Rastell had plays acted in his own
garden, "fieri fecit" seems exactly translatable by "caused to be
produced," and as Mrs. Rastell helped the tailor to make the dresses,
so probably the lawyer-printer helped to write the play. Its two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
parts are each diversified by the Plowman beating Knight and Merchant
(<i>verberat eos</i> is the stage-direction), but otherwise it is all sheer
argument, which in the end a philosopher is introduced to sum up.
The tone of the interlude is singularly democratic, the Plowman
throughout having the best of it, and, despite a natural similarity between
some of the speeches with those of the "Gentylman" and the
"Marchaunt" in the <i>Play of the Wether</i>, there seems no reason for
connecting with it the name of Heywood, who, for the better part of
his life, was in the service of the Court.</p>

<p>In "<i>The playe called the foure PP.</i>: a newe and a very mery enterlude
of a palmer, a pardoner, a potycary, a pedler," the advance in
dramatic form as compared with <i>The Play of Love</i> is very slight,
though the play is much more vivid and amusing. The Palmer
begins it with an account of his wanderings, and then the other three
characters come on the stage, each catching up the words of the last
speaker, and vaunting his own profession. The argument between
Palmer, Pardoner, and Pothecary waxes hot, and at last the Pedler
suggests that as lying is the one matter in which they are all skilled,
their order of merit can best be determined by a contest in this art,
and offers himself as the judge. At first the competitors lie vaguely.
Then it is resolved that the lie must take the form of a tale, and the
Pothecary tells a long story of the effect of one of his medicines;
then the Pardoner a much longer one of a visit to Hell and the
rescue thence of a shrew of whom Lucifer was very glad to be rid;
finally the Palmer in a few words expresses his surprise that there
should be such shrews in Hell, as in all his travels he never yet knew
one woman out of patience&mdash;a remark which straightway wins him
the preëminence, though there is more tedious wrangling, before a
serious little speech from the Pedler brings the play to a close.
The <i>Four PP.</i> is, to our thinking, insufferably spun out; but, except
in the epilogue, as we may call it, it is plain that its intention was
solely to amuse&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To passe the tyme in thys without offence</div>
<div class="i0">Was the cause why the maker dyd make it,</div>
<div class="i0">And so we humbly beseche you take it,</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="noin">says the Pedler:&mdash;and in substituting stories and a lighter form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
argument for the more formal disputation of the <i>Dyaloge of Wit and
Folly</i> and the <i>Play of Love</i> it comes a little nearer to the modern
conception of comedy, and may be thought to have deserved the
success which it is said to have achieved.</p>

<p>The possession by the <i>Play of the Wether</i> of an obvious moral&mdash;the
mess which men would make of rain, wind, and sunshine if they
had the ruling of them&mdash;is undoubtedly a link with the interludes
of a didactic character, and so may seem at first sight to place it in
a lower grade of dramatic development. There can be little doubt
that it was acted by Heywood's company of "children," whom we
hear of as performing under his direction before the Princess Mary,
and a children's play would perhaps naturally be cast in this form.
But the form is here less important than the intention, and it does
not need Mery-report's comment ("now shall ye have the wether&mdash;even
as yt was") to tell us that Heywood's didactics were purely
humorous. The point to be noted is that this is really a play&mdash;a
play, moreover, which if it could be shortened and the unforgivable
passages omitted, might be acted by children of the present day with
some enjoyment. The part of "the Boy, the least that can play"
is charming. There is stage furniture in Jupiter's "trone," and in
the coming and going of the characters at least a semblance of action.
We must note, however, the set disputation between the two
millers, as still linking it with Heywood's other argumentative plays,
though with all its faults it is the brightest and most pleasing of its
class.</p>

<p>We come now to the two plays, <i>The Pardoner and the Frere</i> and
<i>Johan Johan</i>, which modern writers have uniformly assigned to
Heywood, although William Rastell printed them<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> without any
author's name, and no one has yet adduced contemporary evidence
for assigning them to Heywood. In neither of these plays is there
any trace of the disputation which in those we have been looking at
is so conspicuous. They are both true comedies, comedies in miniature
if you like, but true comedies, with a definite scene and dramatic
action. <i>The Pardoner and the Frere</i> is little more than an
expansion of hints given by Chaucer, from whom the author does
not hesitate to borrow two whole passages, but the development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the little plot is well managed and the climax when the Parson and
Neighbour Prat are badly worsted and the two rogues go off in
triumph is thoroughly artistic. It has been said that this play must
have been written during the life of Leo X., who died in 1521,
because the Pardoner's speech contains the passage (omitting the
Friar's interruptions):&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Worshypfull maysters ye shall understand</div>
<div class="i0">That Pope Leo the X hath graunted with his hand,</div>
<div class="i0">And by his bulls confyrmed under lede,</div>
<div class="i0">To all maner people, bothe quycke and dede,</div>
<div class="i0">Ten thousand yeres &amp; as many lentes of pardon, etc.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>But as Heywood was probably born in 1497, it is extremely unlikely
that his undoubted plays were written before 1520, and if the
evidence of this passage is to be pressed, I should regard it as absolutely
fatal to his authorship, it being inconceivable that any one
who had written the <i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> could subsequently write
the <i>Dyaloge of Wyt and Folly</i> or the <i>Play of Love</i>. But there would be
an obvious convenience in making a dead pope rather than a living
one answerable for the Pardoner's ribaldries, and the weight of this
argument is not lessened when we remember that the Pardoner
proceeds to quote also the authority of the King.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Although
no alteration of date would bring the play out of the reign of
Henry VIII., we may well believe that that peremptory monarch
might forgive such reflections on his management of church affairs
at an earlier date much more readily than satire of a system he was
then supporting.</p>

<p>We shall have to speak again of the <i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> and its
probable date, but we must pass on now to Heywood's masterpiece,
if we may call it his, the <i>mery play betwene Johan Johan, the husbande,
Tyb his wyfe and Syr Jhan, the preest</i>. In approaching this
play, as in approaching Chaucer's tales of the Miller and Reeve
and some of their fellows, we must, of course, leave our morality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
behind and accept the playwright's and tale-teller's convention that
cuckoldry and cuckoldmaking are natural subjects for humour. This
granted, it will be difficult to find a flaw in the play. Like the
<i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> it is short, only about one half the length of
the plays of <i>Love</i>, the <i>Wether</i>, and the <i>Four PP.</i>, and it gains greatly
from being less weighted with superfluities. Johan Johan himself,
with his boasting and cowardice, his eagerness to be deceived, and
futile attempts to put a good face on the matter, his burning desire
to partake of the pie, his one moment of self-assertion, to which
disappointed hunger spurs him, and then his fresh collapse to ludicrous
uneasiness,&mdash;who can deny that he is a triumph of dramatic
art, just human enough and natural enough to seem very human
and natural on the stage, but with the ludicrous side of him so
sedulously presented to the spectator that there is never any risk of
compassion for him becoming uncomfortably acute? The handling
of Tyb and Syr Jhan is equally clever. Each in turn is prepared
to act on the defensive, to be evasive and explanatory, but before
Johan Johan's acquiesciveness such devices seem superfluous, and
little by little the pair reach a height of effrontery not easily surpassed.
One of the incidents of the play, the melting of the wax
by the fire, occurs also in a contemporary French <i>Farce nouuelle tresbonne
et fort ioyeuse de Pernet qui va au vin</i>, and it is certainly in the
French farces that we find the nearest approach in tone and treatment,
as well as in form, to this anonymous Johan Johan.</p>

<p><b>Dates. The Authorship of "Thersites."</b>&mdash;It may have been noticed
that in passing these six plays in review the order followed has been
purely that of their dramatic development. We know that four of
them were printed in 1533, when Heywood was thirty-six or thereabouts,
but with the exception of the reference to Leo X. in the <i>Pardoner
and the Frere</i>, the significance of which I have given reasons
for considering doubtful, no one has yet detected any time-reference
which enables us to fix their approximate dates.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In his little
treatise <i>John Heywood als Dramatiker</i> (1888) Dr. Swoboda maintains
that the <i>Pardoner</i> must be placed earlier than the <i>Four PP.</i>, and
that the <i>Four PP.</i> can be shown to be earlier than the anonymous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>play of <i>Thersites</i>, which we know from its epilogue was acted at
Court between October 12 and 24, 1537, the dates respectively
of the birth of Edward VI. and the death of his mother, Jane Seymour.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
In support of his first point he cites the fact that some of
the relics ("the grete toe of the Trinite" and "of all Hallows the
blessed jawbone") vaunted by the Pardoner in his sermon in the
church appear again in the longer list of relics in the <i>Four PP.</i>
In support of the second he quotes from <i>Thersites</i> the lines<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in which
that hero proposes to visit Purgatory and Hell, and traces in them
an allusion to the Pardoner's story in the <i>Four PP.</i> I cannot
accept either of these arguments as decisive chronologically, it
being quite as reasonable for a dramatist to abridge a list of relics
as to expand it, while the boast of Thersites might be represented
as the hint out of which the rescue of Mistress Margery Coorson
was developed no less plausibly than as a reference to that notorious
lie. The <i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> seems to me dramatically more
advanced than the <i>Four PP.</i>, and I am therefore slow to accept any
argument which would place it earlier; but even when we allow
for the fact that Chaucer had fixed for all time the humorous treatment
of Pardoners, the fact that the Pardoners in these two plays
are so closely alike is an argument of some weight for their common
authorship.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But if this be so, the reference to sweeping Hell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>clean in <i>Thersites</i> may set us wondering whether it was not the
author of the <i>Four PP.</i> who was most likely to have written it;
and we may note also the repetition in <i>Thersites</i> of the absurd
boasting with which Johan Johan preludes his disclosure of his
cowardice, while the incident of Telemachus belongs to that
"humour of filth" which I have already noted as characteristic
of Heywood. For the probability of the latter's authorship of
<i>Thersites</i> we may claim also a little external support. We have
already noticed that in March, 1538, Heywood received forty shillings
for the performance by his "children" of an interlude before
the Princess Mary. Now <i>Thersites</i> is obviously intended for performance
by children; it was acted a few months previously to the payment
of March, 1538,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in honour of Jane Seymour, to whom Mary,
in return for her abundant kindness, was greatly attached; and again
Mary's fondness for the classics would explain the selection of a
classical burlesque if, as is probable, she was present when it was
acted. Given the facts that Heywood had already in the <i>Play of
the Wether</i> brought Jupiter on the stage, that <i>Thersites</i> bears at
least some slight resemblances to other plays attributed to him,
that he was in the service of the Princess Mary, and was manager,
whether permanently or temporarily, about this time, of a company
of children, and I think we have a fairly strong case for attributing
<i>Thersites</i> to his pen. If this theory be accepted, the probability of
his authorship of both the <i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> and <i>Johan Johan</i>
is considerably increased; for if <i>Thersites</i> is by Heywood, it is good
enough to form an important link between these plays and his argumentative
interludes, while if <i>Thersites</i> be not by Heywood, there
was then some other playwright of the day for whom a strong claim
might be put forward to the authorship of these other anonymous
plays.</p>

<p><b>Sources.</b>&mdash;The fact that an opportunity for writing about Heywood
is not likely to recur very often must be offered as an excuse
for interpolating questions of detail into this preface. For the
broader view of the subject which we ought here to take it is obvious
that the authorship of this or that play is not very important. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>concerns us here is that we can see even in the less developed group
of plays English comedy emancipating itself from the miracle-play
and morality, and in the <i>Pardoner and the Frere</i> and <i>Johan Johan</i>
becoming identical in form with the French fifteenth-century farce.
Whether we ought to go beyond this and assert absolute borrowing
from French originals is rather a difficult question. The <i>Farce
nouuelle d'un Pardonneur, d'un triacleur et d'une tauerniere</i> may certainly
have supplied the idea both of the preaching-match between
Pardoner and Friar and also of the comparison of the wares of Pardoner
and Pothecary. The <i>Farce nouuelle tresbonne et fort ioyeuse de
Pernet qui va au vin</i> contains two passages<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which must have some
direct connection with <i>Johan Johan</i>. The only extant edition of
Pernet qui va au vin was "nouvellement imprimé" in 1548, and
the date of its prototype is unknown. The <i>Farce d'un Pardonneur</i>,
in the edition which has come down to us, is certainly later than
1540, but this also was probably a reprint. Thus despite the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>that the handling of the incidents in the English plays is far more
skilful than in the French, it would seem too daring to suggest that
the French farces can be borrowed from the English, and in any
case we may imagine that the English dramatist did not make his
new departure unaided, but was consciously working on the lines
which had long been popular in France. By doing so he did not
lay the foundation of English comedy, for it was not on these lines
that our comedy subsequently developed. But it was at least a hopeful
omen for the future that an English playwright so easily attained
a real mastery in the only school of comedy with which he could
have been acquainted. It was something also that the right of
comedy to exist as a source of amusement apart from instruction
had been successfully vindicated. These were two real achievements,
and they must always be connected with the name of John
Heywood.</p>

<p><b>"Play of the Wether": Early Editions and the Present Text.</b>&mdash;At
the time I write, the <i>Play of the Wether</i> has not been reprinted since
the sixteenth century. Its bibliography has been rather confused
by the existence of two texts of it, one at St. John's College, Oxford,
the other at the University Library, Cambridge, each wanting the last
leaf, containing in the one case twenty, and in the other sixteen, lines
of the text and the colophon with the printer's name. The only perfect
copy hitherto generally known is that preserved at the Bodleian
Library, which belongs to an edition "Imprinted at London in Paules
Churchyearde, at the Sygne of the Sunne, by Anthonie Kytson"
whose career as a publisher seems to have been comprised within the
years 1549 and 1579. Of this as the only complete edition I then
knew I made my first transcript, though subsequent collation showed
that the imperfect edition at St. John's College contained many better
readings and an earlier spelling, while the copy at the University
Library, Cambridge (sometimes, though I think erroneously, attributed
to the press of Robert Wyer), belonged to an intermediate
edition. The registration by the Bibliographical Society in its <i>Hand-lists
of English Printers</i>, 1501-1556, of the copy of an edition of 1533,
printed by William Rastell, in the Pepys Collection at Magdalene
College, Cambridge, sent me to Cambridge for a new transcript.
On examination, the Magdalene edition proved to be identical with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
that at St. John's College, Oxford, which had previously been conjecturally
assigned to Rastell, perhaps by some one who had seen it
before the last leaf disappeared. In reproducing Rastell's text I
have not thought it necessary to print my collation of the later editions,
as it is clear that the unidentified edition at the University
Library, Cambridge (U. L. C.), was printed from Rastell's, and Kitson's
from this. The printer of the U. L. C. edition introduced
some errors into his text, most of which Kitson copied: e.g. <i>hote</i> for
<i>hore</i> in l. 38, omission of second <i>so</i> in l. 68, and of second <i>as</i> in
l. 72, <i>name</i> for <i>maner</i> in l. 115, <i>or</i> for <i>of</i> in l. 357, <i>we</i> for <i>I</i> in l. 427,
<i>plumyng</i> for <i>plumpyng</i> in l. 657, <i>thynges</i> for <i>thynge</i> in l. 660, <i>showryng</i>
for <i>skowryng</i> in l. 661, <i>ye</i> for <i>yt</i> in l. 699, <i>and</i> for <i>all</i> in l. 705, <i>belyke</i>
for <i>be leak[e]y</i> in l. 800; though he corrected a few: e.g. <i>pale</i> for <i>dale</i>
in l. 277. On the other hand, Kitson introduced some sixty or
seventy errors of his own, such as <i>creatour</i> for <i>creature</i> in l. 5, <i>well</i>
for <i>we</i> in l. 21, <i>myngled</i> for <i>mynglynge</i> in l. 144, <i>mery</i> for <i>mary</i> in
l. 366, <i>beseched</i> for <i>besecheth</i> in l. 347, <i>pycked</i> for <i>prycked</i> in l. 467,
<i>bodily</i> for <i>boldely</i> in l. 470, <i>solyter</i> for <i>solycyter</i> in l. 496, etc. As these
variations are obviously misprints and nothing more, it would have
been pedantic to record them in full, and these samples will doubtless
suffice. The following title-page is a representation, not a
reproduction, of the original. There is no running head-line in
Rastell's text.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> Dr. Swoboda erroneously places Edward VI.'s birth in August, a slip of some importance
as to some extent spoiling his argument that <i>Thersites</i> must have been written for a performance
at an earlier date. But perhaps even in October it would not be quite correct to say "All herbs
are dead," while the reference to a New Year's gift, though not quite decisive, makes it probable
that the play was written for a Christmas entertainment. In any case it is intrinsically probable
that a play acted at an improvised festivity on the birth of an heir to the throne would be
an old one, rather than specially written for the occasion.</p></div>

father (John), was apparently unaware that neither <i>The Pardoner and the Frere</i> nor <i>Johan
Johan</i> bears Heywood's name, and takes his authorship of them for granted.</p></div>

shows that Heywood was a likely man to be called on to produce a play about this period.</p></div>

JOHAN JOHAN</h2>

<p><b>Previous Editions and the Present Text.</b>&mdash;An edition of "A Mery
Play between Johan Johan, the Husbande, Tyb, his Wyfe and Syr
Jhan, the Preest, attributed to John Heywood 1533,"<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> was printed
at the Chiswick Press by C[harles] Whittingham "from an unique
copy in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford," some time in the first
half of the present century.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The anonymous editor prefaces it
with the following brief "advertisement":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is one of the six Plays attributed by our dramatic biographers to
John Heywood, author of <i>The Four P's</i> (contained in Dodsley's collection),
of 'the Spider and Flie,' and of some other poems, an account of which
may be found in the Third Volume of Warton's History of English Poetry.
No copy of this Mery Play appears to exist except that in the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford, from which this is a faithful reprint. Exclusive of its
antiquity and rarity, it is valuable as affording a specimen of the earliest and
rudest form of our Comedy (for the Poem is shorter, &amp; the number of the
Dramatis Personæ yet fewer than those of the <i>Four P's</i>) &amp; of the liberty
with which even the Roman Catholic authors of that age felt themselves
authorized to treat the established priesthood."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ashmolean copy (now in the Bodleian Library) can no longer
be reckoned unique, another copy having been discovered in the
Pepys collection at Magdalene College, Cambridge. This copy has
been used in correcting the Chiswick Press text, and it may be as
well to mention that the following changes, besides a good many
minor ones, have been made on its authority, and are not surreptitious
emendations of the present editor.</p>

<p>In the apportionment of ll. 240-266 between the two speakers,
my predecessor, like myself, though not in the same manner, has
departed from Rastell's (clearly erroneous) arrangement of the
speeches, but his dislike of footnotes has caused him to omit any
mention of the fact. The title-page is a representation, not a <i>facsimile</i>.
There is no running head-line in the original.</p>

CRITICAL ESSAY </h3>

<p><b>Life.</b>&mdash;Nicholas Udall was born in 1506, of a good family residing in
Hampshire. As a lad of fourteen he entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
and took his bachelor's degree there in May, 1524.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The years of his University
life came at a period of great religious fermentation, and young Udall
was, according to an old tradition,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> one of the young enthusiasts in whom
the humanistic tilling of Erasmus had prepared the soil for Lutheran doctrines
from Wittenberg. We may, therefore, imagine young Udall to have been
one of those of whose heretical perversities Warham complains to Wolsey.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Apparently Udall, as he grew older, grew if not calmer at least more cautious,
and succeeded later in gaining the favour of Mary the Princess, and in
retaining that of Mary the Queen. While at college, he formed a lasting
friendship with John Leland, a friendship of which some poems of the latter
give us a pleasing testimony.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Leland, of almost the same age as Udall, had
taken his first degree at Cambridge in 1522, and according to an old custom,
he continued his studies at Oxford, where Udall's generosity won his heart.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
In May, 1533, a number of verses were composed by them in joint authorship,
for a pageant at the coronation of Anne Boleyn.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In the same year
Udall seems to have settled at London as a teacher. He may even have contemplated
becoming a monk&mdash;like Thomas More thirty years earlier; he
certainly dates his preface to the <i>Flowers from Terence</i> from the Augustinian
Monastery at London, on the last of February, 1534. In the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>June he received the degree of Master of Arts from Oxford, and appears in
the latter part of the same year as "Magister Informator" at Eton, succeeding
Master Richard Coxe.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In this capacity he received payments between
the last terms, 1534 and 1541.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>We can scarcely judge at this late day of the character of Udall's educational
services, but the fact that he was generally on good terms with his
pupils may reasonably be inferred from the preface to the edition of the
<i>Flowers</i>, printed in 1545.</p>

<p>We may further infer with regard to his mastership at Eton, that he was
himself influenced by the Eton custom of performing a play at Christmas. It
appears even possible that the clause in a "consuetudinary" of Eton (about
1560), allowing the Latin school comedy to give place to an English one,
if it were "witty and graceful,"<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> may have been a result of Udall's mastership.
And it is probable that <i>Roister Doister</i> was originally one of such
plays unpretentiously offered by Udall to his boys,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> modestly put aside after
the performance and printed long afterwards. If all this be true, Udall's
mastership deserves immortal fame in the annals of English literature. But
the immortality is unfortunately of a different nature. Udall is stigmatized
by one ungrateful pupil as a second <i>Orbilius plagosus</i>, the realization of Erasmus's
executioner. Tusser's often quoted doggerel runs:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"From Paules I went to Eaton sent</div>
<div class="i0">To learn streight waies, the latin phraies,</div>
<div class="i0">When fiftie three stripes giuen to mee</div>
<div class="i4">At once I had:</div>
<div class="i0">For fault but small, or none at all,</div>
<div class="i0">It came to pas, thus beat I was,</div>
<div class="i0">See Udall see, the mercie of thee,</div>
<div class="i4">To me poore lad."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></div>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We cannot now decide upon the merits of the case, but we are inclined
to think that Tom Tusser the boy was as shiftless as Thomas Tusser the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>man later proved to be, and that, although he may have been a fine "querister,"
his "latin phraies" would frequently offend the ear of the conscientious
humanist. Let us suppose that Thomas deserved his fifty-three
stripes twice over, but did not realize that ὁ μὴ δαρεὶς ἄνθρωπος οὐκ παιδεύεται.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1541,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> some abuses were exposed that had lately disgraced the
school. A robbery of plate and silver images was detected, to which two
late Eton scholars and a servant of Udall's confessed; and Udall himself
became "suspect to be counsel of the robbery." The judicial report states
that Udall "having certain interrogatoryes ministred unto hym toching the
sayd fact and other felonious trespasses whereof he was suspected, did confess
that he did comitt a heinous offence with the sayd cheney [a "scoler" of
Eton] sundry tymes hertofore and of late the vjᵗʰ day of this present monethe
in this present yere at London: whereupon he was committed to the Marshalsey."</p>

<p>Udall was discharged from his office, but did not remain long in prison
(as would have been the case if he had been proved guilty of a "felonious"
crime); and an influential personage unknown to us made efforts to bring
about his "restitucion to the roume of Scholemaister in Eton." Udall
thanked this patron in an interesting letter, which seems to corroborate the
words of the indictment, but states that the "heinous offence" was committed
in London (<i>not</i> in Eton), and that it resulted in heavy debts. The
most careful consideration of the letter leads me to believe that Udall had
nothing to do with the <i>theft</i>, but had neglected his duties as teacher, and
had not given the right example of "frugall livyng."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Most likely he had
only followed the royal example; had enjoyed too much "Pastyme with
good companye!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>

In the same letter Udall petitions for a place where he could show his
"amendment," and which would enable him also "by litle and litle ... to
paye euery man his own."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>We do not know of the result of this letter, but it seems that Udall went
"north" in the autumn of the same year. At any rate, in October, 1542,
Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle, received letters "by the hande of Mr.
Vdall";<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and Leland in a charming little song addressed to his "snow-white
friend," refers to Udall as residing among the "Brigantes, where
Mars now has the rule."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>In the same autumn appeared Udall's translation of Erasmus's <i>Apophthegms</i><a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
and&mdash;after his return south&mdash;he was connected for the following three
years with a great literary undertaking, which was not only favoured by the
Court, but progressing under its auspices and with its collaboration,&mdash;Princess
Mary taking the most active part. This was the English translation of
Erasmus's <i>Paraphrase of the New Testament</i>.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Under Edward VI., Udall devoted himself to theological works; he stood
up for the royal prerogative in religious matters in his <i>Answer to the articles
of the commoners of Devonshire and Cornwall</i> (summer 1549<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>); he took his
share in a memorial volume published in 1551, after Bucer's death, and he
translated in the same year Peter Martyr's <i>Tractatus</i> and <i>Disputatio De Eucharistia</i>.
A royal patent<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> (of 1551) granted him the "privilege and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>lycense ... to preint the Bible in Englyshe as well in the large volume for
the use of the churches wᵗʰin this our Realme ... as allso in any other
convenient volume."</p>

<p>This privilege was not the only sign of royal favour: we find Udall in
November, 1551, presented by the King to a prebend in Windsor,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and later
(in March, 1553) to the Parsonage of Calborne, in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>After such favours received from Edward, and such services in the Protestant
camp, we should expect to find Udall in disgrace under Queen Mary,
and sharing with his fellow-Protestants at least the bitter fate of exile, but
Mary had apparently preserved a grateful memory for her former fellow-worker
in the Erasmian translation. If, indeed, she did not use him as a
theologian, she remembered his dramatic talents, and so we find that a special
warrant was issued, December 3, 1554, which shows us Udall in the rôle
of playwright. The Office of the Queen's Revels was directed by the
warrant referred to, to deliver to Udall such "apparel" at any time as he
might require for the "setting foorth of Dialogues and Enterludes" before
the Queen, for her "regell disporte and recreacion." In the beginning of
the document<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> appears an allusion to Udall as having shown previously "at
soondrie seasons" his "dilligence" in arranging "Dialogues and Enterludes"&mdash;important
documentary evidence of his connection with the
"Revels," a connection apparently begun with the pageant for which he
furnished such poor verses at Anne Boleyn's coronation.</p>

<p>This evidence for the fact that Udall was known as a writer of "plays"
before 1554 is singularly corroborated by the quotation of Roister's letter
to Custance (Act III., Scene iv.) as an example of "ambiguity" in the
1553 edition of Wilson's <i>Rule of Reason</i>.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>

As to the nature of Udall's "Dialogues," "Enterludes," and "devises,"
we are not entirely without information. The very date of the warrant
would indicate the occasion for Udall's services (December 3, 1554), if
we had not a more definite statement. He was commissioned to get up the
Christmas shows before Mary and Philip.</p>

<p>Udall was in a dangerous position, since any reference to the Protestant
sympathies of the nation might have cost his life, but he realized the situation,
and with good tact presented "divers plaies," the "incydents" of
which were very innocent:<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> "A mask of patrons of gallies like Venetian
senators, with galley-slaves for their torche-bearers; a mask of 6 Venuses
or amorous ladies with 6 Cupids and 6 torche-bearers to them," and some
"Turkes archers,"<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> "Turkes magistrates," and "Turkie women," "6
lions' hedds of paste and cement," and a few other harmless paraphernalia.</p>

<p>How long Udall served the queen in this capacity we do not know. In
1555, towards the end of his career, we find him at his old calling as
master of Westminster School.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> When in November of the following year
the old monastery was again opened, naturally Udall's services became
superfluous, and he was doubtless discharged; and so indeed the darkness
enshrouding the last months of his life may cover a period of great distress.
He died in December, 1556, and found his last resting place in St. Margaret's,
Westminster; where almost thirty years before Skelton had found first
a sanctuary and then a grave.</p>

<p>It seems that the queen did not erect a monument over the ashes of her
old friend, at least none is registered by the industrious Weever;<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> but Udall
does not need a monument from Queen Mary, he has erected it himself&mdash;<i>ære
perennius</i>&mdash;in the annals of English literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>

<b>Date of the Play.</b>&mdash;<i>Roister Doister</i> was formerly assigned to the
time of Udall's mastership at Eton (1534-41).<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In more recent
years, however, this date has been rejected, and Professor J. W.
Hales has tried to show that "this play was in fact written in
1552, and more probably written for Westminster school."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>The arguments of Professor Hales, as far as I can see, might be
summarized thus:</p>

<p>1. The fact that Wilson&mdash;an old Eton boy himself, who left
the school in 1541, and ought to have known of the play if it had
ever been performed there&mdash;does <i>not</i> insert the "ambiguous letter"
in his first and second editions of the <i>Rule of Reason</i> (1551, 1552),
whereas he inserts it in the edition of 1553, "<i>suggests</i> that this <i>comedy
was written between the appearances of the second and the third editions</i>."</p>

<p>In favour of this theory speak further&mdash;according to Professor
Hales&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The fact that Bale does not mention any of Udall's comedies
in the 1548 edition of his <i>Catalogus</i>;</p>

<p>3. The fact that "about 1552" Udall was in high esteem as a
"comic dramatist";</p>

<p>4. The fact that Udall quotes a number of proverbial phrases
which he got from Heywood's proverbs, published first in 1546;</p>

<p>5. The fact that the usury statute of 37 Henry VIII. was repealed
in 1552, "of some moment" as far as the "reference [in
the play] to excessive usury" is concerned.</p>

<p>The first argument is doubtless the strongest, but I venture to
argue that the quotation of 1553 does <i>not</i> prove that the play was
<i>written</i> in 1552, but only that Wilson was unable <i>to use a copy of
the play</i> before 1553; whether this copy was a manuscript copy, or
<i>a printed</i> (and now lost) edition of the play, we cannot decide;
<i>most probably Wilson's quotation was made from an early edition of
Roister, printed in 1552</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that Wilson left Eton in 1541 seems to make it probable
that he remembered the "ambiguous" passage from his school days.</p>

<p>The second argument is very slight, for Bale does not give a
<i>complete</i> list of Udall's works either in edition 1548 or in edition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>1557; nor does he mention Udall's connection with the coronation
pageants of 1533; and a modest school comedy would naturally
not at once become public property.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> argument is based on a serious anachronism. <i>We do not
know anything</i> of Udall's fame as a "comic dramatist <i>about 1552</i>."
The warrant of December 3, 1554, is dated, and cannot be used
for "about 1552." Besides, the nature of Udall's "dialogues and
interludes" for the "regell disporte and recreacion," as explained
on p. 93, above, excludes any possibility of connecting these "Dialogues"
with the comedy.</p>

<p>The number of proverbial phrases which Udall uses in common
with Heywood's <i>Proverbs</i> (the early date of which, 1546, is rather a
myth) proves no dependence of Udall on Heywood. Their use proves
merely that Udall, as well as Heywood, talked the London English
of his time, and that both were familiar with phrases common in
the early sixteenth century. Any possible number of such phrases
could not prove any "dependence."</p>

<p>With regard to the allusion in <i>Roister Doister</i> to the Usury Statute,
one may readily see that the reference is <i>not</i> to a date later than the
repeal, in 1552, of 37 Henry VIII., c. 9, but to a <i>period between
1545 and 1552</i>. In Act V., Scene vi., lines 21 to 30, Custance
blames Roister humorously, <i>not</i> for taking interest at all, but for
taking <i>too much</i> (fifteen to one!), and for taking it <i>right away</i> instead
of waiting until the year was up. The passage, therefore, does not
refer to the law passed 5 and 6 Edward VI., c. 20 (1552), which
repeals 37 Henry VIII., c. 9, and orders that "no person shall lend
or forbear any sum of money for any maner of Usury or Increase
to be received or hoped for above the Sum lent, upon pain to forfeit
the Sum lent, and the Increase, [with] Imprisonment, and Fine at
the king's pleasure." The passage refers to 37 Henry VIII., c. 20
(1545), to a law which allows ten per cent interest: "The sum of
ten pound in the hundred, and so after that rate and <i>not above</i>," and
which forbids the lender "to receive, accept or take in Lucre or
Gain for the forbearing or giving Day of Payment <i>of one whole year</i>
of and for his or their money," for any other "Period" but the
year, not "for a longer or shorter time." Cf. the technical term
"gain" in line 30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>

If, therefore, Custance's joke can be taken as an indication of
the time when the play was written, it would be an indication
of the period between 1545 and 1552, or, at any rate, <i>before</i> 1552.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>I should, however, not be inclined on account of this reference
to usury to date the play between 1545 and 1552. I would rather
regard the allusion as a later insertion, which ought not to weaken
the force of the internal evidence in favour of the old theory, according
to which the play belongs to the Eton period of Udall's life, to
the years between 1534 and 1541.</p>

<p><b>Date of the Early Edition.</b>&mdash;The Stationers Company's <i>Registers</i>
show (ed. Arber, 1, 331) four pence as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Recevyd of Thomas hackett for hys lycense for pryntinge
of a play intituled Rauf Ruyster Duster,"</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">and the unique copy of the play which has come down to us has
been regarded as the solitary relic of this edition. Title-page and
colophon are lacking.</p>

<p>Hackett, however, printed between October (November?), 1560,
and July, 1589; and Arber dates the unique copy: "? 1566."</p>

<p>This copy is now in the possession of Eton College. On the first
fly-leaf are written the words: "The Gift of the Rev<sup>d</sup> Tho<sup>s</sup> Briggs
to Eton Coll. Library, Dec<sup>r</sup> 1818." As shown above, the quotation
of the "ambiguous" letter in the 1553 edition of Wilson's
<i>Logique</i> speaks, however, in favour of an edition earlier than that of
the unique copy; and this earlier edition might be dated "1552?".<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>

<b>Place of Roister Doister in English Literature.</b>&mdash;<i>Roister Doister</i>
is the only specimen of Udall's dramatic art preserved by Fate, but
it is sufficient to justify us in assigning to the author his place as
father of English Comedy.</p>

<p>The causes that brought a "Latinist," a schoolmaster, a theological
writer to such a position are interesting to consider. Primarily,
of course, it is his genius, his "<i>Froh-natur</i>," his way of
looking at the world, and his art of representing this picture of the
world, to which we owe <i>Roister Doister</i>, but besides this we may
be certain that Udall's classical training, the condition of the Latin
School-comedy of his time, and, finally, his clear insight into the
character of the national play helped him to the place that he holds.</p>

<p>If Udall had been merely a pedantic schoolmaster, one of whose
duties it was to superintend an annual Christmas play, he would
have been satisfied with an adaptation of&mdash;let us say&mdash;the <i>Miles
Gloriosus</i>, or he would merely have translated the <i>Miles</i> as the <i>Andria</i>
had been translated before; perhaps he would even have been satisfied
with a performance of the play in the Latin. On the other
hand, had he never been obliged to drill boys in Terence, his plays
would have remained "interludes" of the old type, and at best, he
would now receive honourable mention by the side of Heywood.
It was his very position as teacher of the classics, his humanism
(apart from the annual necessity of advising the "enterluders" at
Christmas time) which must have pointed out to him the way in
which the "enterlude" might be outgrown, the way that would
lead to a new category of plays: the "comedy."</p>

<p>Udall (if the prologue to <i>Roister Doister</i> is his own, as we have
no reason to doubt)<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> seems to have been somewhat doubtful at first
about the designation of his play; he calls it at the beginning "thys
enterlude"; but he realized the new departure which he had taken,
and calls it later "Our Comedie or Enterlude." By the use of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>word,&mdash;the first time applied correctly to an <i>English</i> comedy,&mdash;Udall
indicates his aspirations, his sources and classical models:
those plays which were the comedies <i>par excellence</i>, the comedies
of Terence, and&mdash;especially since the discovery of the twelve
"new" plays in 1429&mdash;those of Plautus. Udall shows himself a
genuine disciple of the Renaissance; he "imitates" in that true
way in which "imitation" has always ultimately proved "originality":
he shows that he had absorbed the spirit of the Roman
comedy, that he fully understood the easy movement, the sparkling
and refined dialogue, the succinct but full delineation of character,
and the clear development of a plot. But besides all this he possessed
enough patriotic feeling not to overlook the merits of the
modest national "interlude" of England. He did not too anxiously
avoid carrying out here and there even a farcical motive;
but with the higher ideal before him, he succeeded in fusing the
classical and the national elements into a new category, becoming
thus the father of English comedy.</p>

<p>Udall's position appears clearly if one compares his work with
<i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> on the one hand, and&mdash;regarding them as
a type&mdash;with Heywood's farces on the other.</p>

<p>The good taste and higher art of <i>Roister Doister</i> are at once evident:
the play is free from the undeniable vulgarity of <i>Gammer
Gurton</i>, and in delineation of character is distinctly superior. The
plot, simple as it is, is never as meagre as in the clever dialogues
of Heywood; and as much as Udall surpasses Heywood in construction
of the plot, I think he surpasses him in delineation of
character. For even if, as Ward says,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> in Heywood's witty plays,
the "personified abstractions" of the moralities have been entirely
superseded by "personal types," these personal types have not yet
matured into individual persons, into men of flesh and blood, as they
have in Udall's play.</p>

<p>I take, of course, for granted Udall's absolute superiority over
that category of interludes which&mdash;bastards of the "Moralities"&mdash;seem
to have had no other purpose than to introduce dogmatical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>moralizations, seasoned perhaps with a tavern scene or with some
other farcical coarseness, and at best ending with an "unmotived"
conversion of the sinner or sinners.</p>

<p><b>Plot and Characters.</b>&mdash;Udall's plot is so simple that its development
becomes clear at a glance; it consists of the unsuccessful
wooing of Ralph Roister Doister for the hand of Dame Christian
Custance, evolved amid various entanglements, and ultimately unsuccessful,
not so much because Custance is at the time of Roister's
first advances already engaged to another man, as because Roister's
folly is so enormous that no success can be possible.</p>

<p>Now the figure of an avowed fool in love would give excellent
scenes for a farce, but would not yield the complications of character
and situation necessary for a comedy; and in order to bring
about this essential complexity, there is introduced a second motive
for action in this fool's own character,&mdash;that of vainglory. There
is also introduced a personage who shall season the play by his wit
and produce the necessary entanglements. This is Mathew Merygreeke,
who grows gradually under the poet's hands, until he occupies
the most prominent place in the play, at least as far as our
interest in the different characters is concerned. Despite all that
has been said to the contrary, Merygreeke is Udall's own creation,&mdash;a
figure in itself deserving of high praise. Undoubtedly this
character was at first conceived as a mere modern parasite, of a
much higher type, however, than the Sempronio, for instance (in
<i>Calisto and Meliboea</i>), but as the play advanced the figure outgrew
its original limits, and although in the first scenes Merygreeke is
scarcely out of the eggshell of the parasite, he proves very soon to
be a new character: a character belonging to the class of Pandarus,
a "Friend" playing the part of kindly Fate, a Vice certainly
mischievous and cruel enough, but directing everything to a good
end; as full of humour and fun as of character, and, at the bottom
of his heart, of good-nature.</p>

<p>Merygreeke comes indeed to Roister at first "for his stomach's
sake" and wants a new coat, but he has on the whole only a few
traits of the parasite,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and these might be left out without injuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>the play in the least. As soon as he sees Roister in love, his humour
gains the upper hand; he realizes at once what a capital source of
fun this "love" on the part of a vain fool might become, and he
determines to bring about such complications as will yield the
greatest quantity of amusement. His purpose may, indeed, at first
have been merely egotistical, to have the fun himself; but he is
forgiven because all the other persons of the play&mdash;as well as the
audience&mdash;are liberally invited to the feast. Merygreeke may appear
at times as a false friend and thus as an immoral character, but
his flattery is so exaggerated, his lies are so improbable, so enormous,
so amusing to all sane people,&mdash;Roister so fully deserves (indeed
provokes) the cruel treatment,&mdash;that any possible wrath of a
moralizing censor is entirely disarmed. Supreme folly stands outside
the common moral order of things. Even if Merygreeke had
not disclosed his motives, we could see from the respect which is
shown him by Custance and Trusty, that he is far from being a
treacherous parasite. And after all he does not betray his friend.
He rather helps him to what he really desires. And what Roister
most desires in this world is, after all, not the possession of the fair
widow, but the satisfaction of his vanity. How quickly does he
forget his love in the delusion fostered by Merygreeke, that Goodluck
and Custance desire to live in peace with him because they
fear him. The lie is in harmony with poetic justice.</p>

<p>Merygreeke has been characterized<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> as "the Artotrogos of Plautus,
the standing figure of the parasite of the Greek new comedy and
its Latin reproductions." But, though Merygreeke was doubtless
originally planned as the parasite of the play, and though here and
there to the very end of the play we find allusions which corroborate
this, I note, first, that the classical parasite<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> lacks the element
of modern humour, of witty but, after all, good-natured enjoyment of
the mischief which he stirs up; secondly, that Merygreeke is free
from endless and&mdash;to us&mdash;tedious allusions to the "stomach";
and, thirdly, from the vulgar, and almost uninteresting, selfishness,
revealed in such words as these of Gnatho:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Principio ego vos credere ambos hoc mi vehementer volo</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Me huius quicquid faciam id facere maxume causa mea</i>.</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="noin">I may be mistaken, but I cannot find that the classical parasite has
any <i>fine</i> touch of the humour that is inseparable from "humanity,"
from good nature. The classical parasite is, on account of this
deficiency, distinctly inferior to this modern creation.</p>

<p>As completely as in Merygreeke's case, Udall disarms the moralist
in the case of Roister himself, whose lying<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and bragging,
whose cowardice, matched only by his vanity, cannot possibly be
regarded as setting a bad example, because they have reached
dimensions which are grotesque and plainly ridiculous. They result
only in the propagation of his folly, and that is allowed to reap
its&mdash;poor&mdash;external fruit: Roister is "invited" to the banquet
(and Roister has constitutionally a good "stomach"), and he is
made to believe that he is a much "dreaded lion." Fate has fortunately
not pressed the mirror into his hands. He is saved the
sight of the ass's ears visible to every one else.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> And as kind as
Fate is his "friend" Merygreeke, who never reveals to him his
absolute wretchedness, and who has to the last the satisfaction of
knowing Roister a "glad man." Here was a great danger for a
less skilful writer than Udall&mdash;a danger of marring our enjoyment
of Merygreeke's part by inserting traits of a finer or grosser brutality,
a danger of spoiling the whole feast by some drop of malice.
The element of conscious humiliation is absent; the pathetic is
consequently avoided.</p>

<p>The other figures of the play are kept in the background; even
Custance, and Gawin Goodluck, who comes in at the end of the
play to give the <i>coup de grace</i> to Roister's foolish hopes. As a
lover Goodluck is hardly a success. He is so fish-blooded that, in
a scene which savours of a judicial procedure, the evidence of Trusty
becomes necessary before he can be satisfied of the fidelity of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>betrothed. Goodluck is obviously no Romeo. In the widow ready
to marry again Udall presents a good study of character. Custance
is a well-to-do London city-wife of the days of Henry VIII.
and Edward VI., ruling like a queen over servants who themselves
are happily introduced and capitally delineated. We imagine her
neither lean, nor pale, but rather like the wife of Bath&mdash;like her,
resolute and substantial, but more faithful. She is, to a certain
extent, even shrewd; she enjoys fun,&mdash;after she has been made to
see it,&mdash;and she is not without a touch of sentimentality.</p>

<p>Indeed, to Custance Udall has assigned the only serious scene in
the play, Act V., Scene iii. This monologue appears pathetic, and
sounds like a prayer of innocence, extremely well justified in a
woman who finds herself surrounded by difficulties and involved in
a complication which seems to question her honour. The last
words of the complaint indicate, however, that Goodluck would
better not doubt <i>too</i> much, because Custance's patience might reach
a limit, and her natural independence might sharply bring him to
his senses.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> She appears in that very scene as the match of Goodluck,
who will be very happy with her if he gets her.</p>

<p>Udall shows his complete superiority over his predecessors in
these delineations of character even more than in the creation of
the plot. Though in the development of the latter everything fits
together and is arranged in good order and proportion, it is, after
all, the <i>dramatis personæ</i> that interest us most. Udall's persons are
men and women of flesh and blood, interesting and amusing living
beings, not the wax figures of "Sapience" or "Folly," "Virtuous
Living" or "Counterfet Countenance." Udall's persons are vastly
superior to these wooden "dialoguers," whom one feels to be acting
merely for a school-bred morality, and they leave the coarse-grained
but witty figures even of Heywood's farces far behind.</p>

<p>If anything, his <i>persons</i> show that Udall had studied his Plautus
and Terence as a clear and sharp observer,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
and that he had learned
from them where the originals for a comedy were to be found&mdash;in
life, in the actual world surrounding the poet.</p>

"an English play called <i>Ezekias</i>, made by Mr. Udall and handled by King's College men
only," was performed before Elizabeth August 8, 1564, at Cambridge; see Cooper's Preface,
xxxiii. Bale, who does not mention Udall as a playwright in the edition 1548 of his <i>Catalogus</i>
(he mentions only [Ochino's?] <i>Tragoedia de papatu</i>), says in the edition September, 1557,
that Udall wrote "comœdias plures." There is nothing on Udall in his <i>Supplement</i> of

Cf. the "Miscellaneous Extracts from Various Accounts relating to the Office of the

Molyneux at Loseley House, Surrey, would furnish these and perhaps other documents most
valuable for Udall's History and that of the Early Drama.

The "scheme for an interlude, in which the persons of the drama were to be <i>a King</i>,

interesting note on the Terentian Plays, annually performed at the Westminster School. It
seems almost as if here, as well as at Eton, Udall's headmastership had some significance for
the history of the English school comedy.</p></div>

 To Collier has been given the credit of first ("soon after 1820") connecting Udall's
name with <i>Roister Doister</i>, the unique copy of which had been published by the finder, the
Rev<sup>d</sup>. Tho<sup>s</sup>. Briggs, in 1818. But, in the first place, Collier could not have identified
the "ambiguous" letter in "Wilson's <i>Art of Logic</i>, printed by Richard Grafton, 1551," as
he says he did, since "The rule of Reason, contei || nyng the Arte of || Logique, set forth || in
Englishe, || by Thomas || Vuilson. || <i>An.</i> M. D. LI. <i>does not contain the quotation from
Roister Doister</i> (copy in the Bodleian kindly examined for me by Professor Gayley), <i>neither
does the edition of 1552</i> (cf. Arber). On folio 66 of the <i>third</i> edition (1553) appears for
the first time: "An example of soche doubtful writing whiche by reason of poincting maie
haue double sense, and contrarie meaning, taken out of an entrelude made by Nicolas Vdal."
And, in the second place, Collier had been anticipated, in part, for as early as 1748 reference
had been made to the passage from Wilson by Tanner, who writes (<i>Bibliotheca</i>, 8. n.): In
Thos. Wilson's <i>Logica</i>, p. 69 [it is <i>leaf</i> 67 of edition 1567 in my possession] <i>sunt quidem
versus ambigui sensus ex Comœdia quadam huius Nic. Udalli desumpti</i>.</p></div>

of Plautus is the precise prototype." That his character has some fine points, modelled
after the Terentian Thraso, is shown in the notes (cf. especially the last scene).
Roister's character, indeed, is the least original of the play, but he is not Udall's favourite
figure. Udall did not spend as much labour on him as on Merygreeke.</p></div>

APPENDIX </h2>

<p>
<b><a id="A"></a>A. The Metre of Roister Doister.</b>&mdash;Udall's verse is a long line of
9, 10, 11, 12 (and rarely more) syllables; a verse which represents the
Middle English Long Line (or the Middle English <i>Septenarius</i>, as it has
been called for lack of a better name), as we find it, for instance, in <i>Robert
of Gloucester</i>, some Legends, and <i>Robert of Brunne</i>.</p>

<p>This Middle English long line, of either six or seven stresses or accents, is
found in Skelton's <i>Magnyfycence</i>, and other early Plays.</p>

<p>In Roister Doister, on the whole, the lines of six accents seem to prevail, lines
corresponding to the Middle English Alexandrine, or in Udall's case perhaps
rather to the classical <i>senarius</i>, to the <i>trimeter</i> of the Roman comedy as understood
by Udall. But a great number of <i>septenarii</i> occur at the side of these
<i>senarii</i>, distributed all over the play, and in the speeches of different persons.</p>

<p>In many cases it seems even doubtful whether a verse should be regarded
as a <i>senarius</i> or a <i>septenarius</i>.</p>

Berlin, 1886; pp. 230 <i>seq.</i>). The fullest collection of material for a general
history of this classical type in modern literature is contained in Karl
von Reinhardstoettner, <i>Plautus, Spätere Bearbeitungen Plautinischer Lustspiele</i>,
Leipzig, 1886 (pp. 130 <i>seq.</i>, 595-680).</p>

by Herman Graf, <i>Der Mil. Glor. im Englischen Drama bis zur Zeit des
Bürgerkrieges Rostock, s. a.</i> [1891; cf. Koch's note in <i>Englische Studien</i>,
18, 134].</p>

cf. the charming <i>causerie</i> by Julius Thümmel: <i>Der Mil. Glor. bei Shakespeare</i>

<p><b><a id="C"></a>C. Titiville (I. i, 21).</b>&mdash;'Tuteville' was originally the name of a devil
in the French Mystery Plays (cf. Mone, <i>Schauspiele des Mittelalters</i>, 2, 27);<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
from the French Mystery play the name was introduced into the Mysteries
of Germany, England,<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> and Holland. His diabolical occupation is
thus defined in the <i>Myroure of oure Ladye</i> (1 ch. 20; cf. Blunt's note,
342; as well as Skeat's to <i>Pierce Plowm.</i>, C. xiv, 123): "I am a poure
dyuel and my name is Tytyuyllus ... I muste eche day ... brynge
my master a thousande pokes [bags] full of faylynges, &amp; of neglygences in
syllables and wordes that are done in youre order in redynge and in syngynge,
&amp; else I must be sore beten."</p>

<p>This 'function' of the Devil seems to allow a connection<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> with the Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
<i>titivillitium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> "a vile thyng of no value" (Cooper), something very small
and trifling, like the "faylynges and neglygences in syllables" in praying
and reading of the church offices.</p>

<p>In Udall's time the ancient Devil had degenerated, and his name had become
a byword for a low, miserable fellow; cf. the play of <i>Thersites</i>
(Dodsley, 1, 424):&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a id="D"></a>D. Mumblecrust and the Maids (I. iii.).</b>&mdash;1. <i>Mumblecrust.</i> Cooper
quotes the same name from Dekker's <i>Satiromastix</i>, and a Madge Mumblecrust
from <i>Misogonus</i> (1577). Jack M. is the name of a beggar in <i>Patient
Grissel</i>, IV. iii (cf. Cooper). Different compounds are Mumble-news
(Shakesp. <i>L.L.L.</i> V. ii, 464) and Sir John Mumble-matins (Pilkington,
<i>Exposition upon Aggeus</i>, 1, 2).</p>

<p>2. <i>Tibet.</i> Tib (=Isabella) was the typical servant's name; cf. <i>G.G.N.</i>;
Tib and Tom in <i>Ail's Well</i>, II. ii, 24; "every coistrel inquiring for his

<p>The whole dialogue of these women takes us back to the times when it
was no dishonour to women to go "to the ale" and enjoy themselves there
with their gossips; cf. <i>P. Pl.</i>, C. 7, 362; <i>Chester Pl.</i>, 1, 53, etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="E"></a>E. The Mock Requiem</b> (III. iii, 53) is one of the latest instances of
parodies of church services such as are found everywhere in the literature
of the Middle Ages. One of the oldest of such parodies is the <i>Drunkard's
Mass</i>, <i>Missa Gulæ</i>, printed in Halliwell and Wright's <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>, 2,
208 (cf. the <i>Paternoster Goliæ</i>); the <i>Officium Lusorum</i> (printed in <i>Carmina
Burana</i>, 248); the <i>Sequentia falsi evangelii sec. Marcam</i> (<i>Initium S. Evangelii
sec. marcas argenti</i>) in Du Meril, <i>Poés. Pop. Lat. Ant.</i> XII. s.p. 407, etc.</p>

<p>In English Lit. we find similar parodies in the <i>Requiem to the Favourites
of Henry VI</i>. (Ritson's <i>Songs</i>, 101; Furnivall's <i>Polit. Rel. and Love Songs</i>, 6:
For Jake Napes Sowle, <i>Placebo</i>, and <i>Dirige</i>); in <i>Passages</i> of the <i>Court of
Love</i> (Chalmers, <i>Engl. Poets</i>, 1, 377), in the <i>Placebo Dilexi</i> in Skelton's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span><i>Phyllyp Sparowe</i> (perhaps the source for Udall's happy thought); in Dunbar's
<i>Will of Maister Andr. Kennedy</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The parallels to Udall's parody are to be found in Maskell's <i>Monumenta

the whole, of Larimer's opinion;<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> but there were more tolerant men who
ultimately prevailed, and so in course of time one short peal before the
funeral was allowed, and one after it,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and even a threefold peal was permitted

<p>On the history of the Funeral Bell, valuable material is contained in the
<i>Parker Soc.</i> '<i>Index</i>,' s.v. Bells (cf. <i>ib.</i> sub. 'Candles').</p>

<p><b>III. iii, 81, 83</b>: 'Pray for,' etc. If this passage were in a serious context,
interesting deductions could be drawn from it as to Udall's religious
views, and perhaps as to the date of the play. Prayers for the dead were
entirely against the spirit and doctrines of the early Reformers. But here
also less radical views were held, and so we find the Prayer enjoined by
Cranmer, 1534 (<i>Works</i>, 2, 460), by Edward VI. (Injunctions, 1547, <i>ib.</i>
504). To mock the prayer would probably have been unsafe between 1547
and 1556, when Udall died. Edward's <i>Common Prayer Book</i> of 1549 retains
the prayer for the dead (p. 88, 145), but the edition of 1552 is silent
about it (<i>ib.</i> 272, 319). In <i>Elizabeth's Primer</i> of 1559 this <i>Prayer</i> is reintroduced
(cf. Priv. Prayers, 59, 67); but later Protestants again condemn
it, <i>e.g.</i> Whitgift (1574), 3, 364.</p>

<p><b><a id="F"></a>F. Roister as 'vagrant.' IV. iii, 104.</b>&mdash;Of all the statutes against
vagrants, that of 1 Edward VI. (c. 3), 1547, affords the best parallel to
Custance's resolute and humorous words. This law determines that "whosoever
... being not lame shall either like a seruing-man wanting a master,
or like a beggar or after any such other sort be lurking in any house or houses,
or loitering, or idle wandering by the high wayes side, or in streets, cities,
townes, or villages ... then euery such person shall bee taken for a vagabond,
... and it shalbe lawfull ... to any ... person espying the
same, to bring or cause to be brought the said person so liuing idle and <i>loiteringly</i>,
to two of the next justices of the peace," etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="G"></a>G. The prayer and 'song' at the end of the play. V. vi, 47.</b>&mdash;I am
inclined to think that the song which 'they sing' according to the stage
direction, is <i>not</i> given,<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> and that verses 47-59 are <i>spoken</i>, and represent the
'prayer' which the actors would all say kneeling (cf. Nares's <i>Glossary</i>, s.v.
'kneel'). That the 'Queene' referred to is Elizabeth, and not Mary,
becomes clear from the words "God graunt hir as she doth, <i>the Gospell to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>protect</i>."
This proves, too, that these words are not by Udall, but by the
unknown hand that prepared the play for the press under Elizabeth.</p>

<h3> CRITICAL ESSAY </h3>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
<b>Date of the Play and its Authorship.</b>&mdash;The title-page of the earliest
known edition of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i>, printed by Thomas Colwell
in 1575, states that this "right pithy, pleasaunt, and merie
comedie" was "played on stage, not longe ago, in Christes Colledge
in Cambridge," and that it was "made by Mr. S., Mr. of Art."
There is here no intimation that any former edition had appeared.
But the register of the Company of Stationers shows that in the
year ending 22 July, 1563, Colwell paid 4d. for licence to print a
play entitled <i>Dyccon of Bedlam, etc.</i>; and as "<i>Diccon the Bedlam</i>"
is a most important character in <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> (his name,
by good right, standing first in the list of <i>dramatis personæ</i>), there
is a fair presumption that the piece for which Colwell obtained a
licence in 1562-3 was in substance identical with that which he
actually printed in 1575 under another title.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Whether <i>Dyccon</i> was
really published in or soon after 1563, or whether Colwell for some
reason or other allowed twelve years to elapse before carrying out
his intention of publishing the play, cannot now be determined with
certainty; the balance of probability seems, however, to be in
favour of the latter supposition.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>The identity of "Mr. S., Master of Art," to whom the authorship
of the comedy is ascribed on the title-page, appears to be discoverable
by means of certain evidence contained in the bursar's
books of Christ's College, for the knowledge of which the present
editor is indebted to the kindness of the Master of that college,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>Dr. Peile. If we are right in identifying <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i>
with the play which was licenced to the printer in the year ending
22 July, 1563, the performance at Christ's College must have taken
place before that date, for it was not the custom to send a play to
the press before it had been acted. Now, in the academic year
ending Michaelmas, 1563, there is no record of any dramatic representation
having been given in the college. In the preceding year,
1561-62, the accounts mention certain sums "spent at Mr. Chatherton's
playe." The person referred to is William Chaderton, then
Fellow of Christ's; but, as his name does not begin with S, this
entry does not concern our inquiry. In 1560-61 there is no
mention of any play; but in 1559-60 we find the two following
items:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"To the viales at Mr. Chatherton's plaie, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"</p>
<p>"Spent at Mr. Stevenson's plaie, 5<i>s.</i>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>As no evidence to the contrary has been found, it appears highly
probable that the "Mr. S." of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> was William
Stevenson, Fellow of Christ's College from 1559 to 1561. It is
further probable that he is identical with the person of the same
name who was Fellow of the college from 1551 to 1554,<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> and who
appears in the bursar's accounts as the author of a play acted in the
year 1553-54. It may be presumed that he was deprived of his
fellowship under Queen Mary, and was reinstated under Elizabeth.
Whether Stevenson's play of 1559-60 was the same which had
been given six years before, or whether it was a new one, there is
no evidence to show. The former supposition, however, derives
some plausibility from the fact that, as several critics have pointed
out, the allusions to church matters in <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> seem
to indicate a pre-Elizabethan date for its composition.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> At all
events it seems likely that the play of 1553-54 was in English, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>the accounts speak of a Latin play (managed by another Fellow,
named Persevall) as having been performed in the same year.</p>

<p>Of Stevenson's history nothing is known, beyond the bare facts
that he was born at Hunwick in Durham, matriculated as a sizar
in November, 1546, became B.A. in 1549-50, M.A. in 1553, and
B.D. in 1560. He was ordained deacon in London in 1552, appointed
prebendary of Durham in January, 1560-61, and died in
1575, the year in which <i>Gammer Gurton</i> was printed.</p>

<p>It may at first sight appear to be a formidable objection to
Stevenson's authorship of the play, that the title-page of the edition
of 1575 speaks of the representation at Cambridge as having taken
place "not longe ago." But Colwell had had the MS. in his possession
ever since 1563; and there is nothing unlikely in the supposition
that the wording of the original title-page was retained without
any other alteration than the change in the name of the piece.
The title-page, it may be remarked, is undated, the tablet at the foot,
which is apparently intended to receive the date, being left blank.
This fact may possibly indicate that when the printing of the volume
was begun it was anticipated that its publication might have to
be delayed for some time.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> The appearance of the title-page suggests
the possibility that it may have been altered after being set up:
"<i>Gammer gur</i>-| <i>tons Nedle</i>" in small italic may have been substituted
for <b>Diccon of</b> | <b>Bedlam</b> in type as large as that of the other
words in the same lines. In Colwell's edition of Ingelend's <i>Disobedient
Child</i> (printed 1560) the title-page has the same woodcut
border, but the name of the piece is in type of the same size as that
of the preceding and following words. As this woodcut does not
occur in any other of Colwell's publications now extant, it seems
reasonable to infer that <i>Gammer Gurton</i> was printed long before 1575.</p>

<p><b>Former Attributions of Authorship</b>.&mdash;It is necessary to say something
about the two persons to whom the authorship of <i>Gammer
Gurtons Nedle</i> has hitherto been attributed&mdash;Dr. John Bridges, who
was in succession Dean of Salisbury and Bishop of Oxford, and
Dr. John Still, who was made Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1593.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>It is curious that both the distinguished churchmen who have been
credited with the composition of this very unclerical play received
the degree of D.D. in the same year in which it was published.</p>

<p>The evidence on which it has been attempted to assign the play
to John Bridges is contained in certain passages of the "Martin
Marprelate" tracts. In the first of these, the <i>Epistle</i>, published in
1588, the author addresses Bridges in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have bin a worthy writer, as they say, of a long time; your first
book was a proper enterlude, called <i>Gammar Gurtons Needle</i>. But I think
that this trifle, which sheweth the author to have had some witte and invention
in him, was none of your doing, because your books seeme to proceede
from the braynes of a woodcocke, as having neither wit nor learning."</p></blockquote>

<p>In his second pamphlet, the <i>Epitome</i>, "Martin Marprelate" twice
alludes to the dean's supposed authorship of the play, in a manner
which conveys the impression that he really believed in it. None
of "Martin's" adversaries seem to have contradicted his statement
on this point, though Cooper in particular was at great pains to
refute the pamphleteer's "slanders" on other dignitaries. It must
be admitted that everything that is known of Bridges is decidedly
favourable to the supposition that he might have written comedy in
his youth. His voluminous <i>Defence of the Government of the Church
of England</i> abounds in sprightly quips, often far from dignified in
tone; and his controversial opponents complained, with some justice,
of his "buffoonery." He is recorded by Harrington to have
been a prolific writer of verse; and that his interests were not
exclusively theological appears from the fact that he is said to have
translated, in 1558, three of Machiavelli's <i>Discourses</i>, having previously
resided in Italy. The only reason for rejecting "Martin
Marprelate's" attribution of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> to him is that
he was not "Mr. S.," and that he belonged not to Christ's College,
but to Pembroke. But as he was resident at Cambridge in 1560
(having taken the degree of A.M. in that year), it is quite possible
that he may have assisted William Stevenson in the composition or
revision of the play.</p>

<p>The name of Bishop Still is so familiar as that of the reputed
author of <i>Gammer Gurton</i>, that many readers will be surprised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
learn that this attribution was first proposed in 1782 by Isaac Reed
in his enlarged edition of Baker's <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Reed
discovered in the accounts of Christ's College an entry referring
to a play acted at Christmas, 1567 (not 1566, as he states); and as
this is the latest entry of the kind occurring before 1575, he plausibly
inferred that it related to the representation of <i>Gammer Gurtons
Nedle</i>, which in Colwell's title-page was stated to have taken place
"not long ago." The only Master of Arts of the college then
living, whose surname began with S, that he was able to find,
was John Still, whom he therefore confidently identified with the
"Mr. S." who is said to have written <i>Gammer Gurton</i>. If our
arguments in favour of Stevenson's authorship be accepted, Reed's
conclusion of course falls to the ground; and the character of
Bishop Still, as it is known from the testimony of several of his
personal friends, renders it incredible that he can ever have distinguished
himself as a comic writer. The characteristic quality
by which he seems chiefly to have impressed his contemporaries
was his extraordinary seriousness. Archbishop Parker, in 1573,
speaks of him as "a young man," but "better mortified than some
other forty or fifty years of age"; and another eulogist commends
"his staidness and gravity." If Still's seriousness had been, like
that of many grave and dignified persons, in any eminent degree
qualified by wit, there would surely have been some indication of
the fact in the vivaciously written account of him given by Harrington.
But neither there nor elsewhere is there any evidence
that he ever made a joke, that he ever wrote a line of verse, or
that he had any interests other than those connected with his sacred
calling. A fact which has often been remarked upon as strange by
those who have accepted the current theory of Still's authorship
of <i>Gammer Gurton</i> is that in 1592, when he was vice-chancellor
of Cambridge, his signature, followed by those of other heads of
houses, was appended to a memorial praying that the queen would
allow a Latin play to be substituted for the English play which she
had commanded to be represented by the university actors on the
occasion of her approaching visit. The memorialists urged that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the performance of English plays had not been customary in the
university, being thought "nothing beseminge our students." It is
not necessary to attribute much importance to this incident, but, so
far as it has any bearing on the question at all, it goes to support
the conclusion, already certain on other grounds, that the author
of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> cannot have been John Still.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p><b>Place in the History of Comedy.</b>&mdash;In attempting to assign the place
of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> in the history of the English drama, we
should remember that it is the sole surviving example of the vernacular
college comedies&mdash;probably more numerous than is commonly
suspected&mdash;produced during the sixteenth century, and that
most of the features which appear to us novel were doubtless the
result of a gradual development. So far as our knowledge goes,
however, it is the second English comedy conforming to the structural
type which modern Europe has learned from the example of the
Roman playwrights. The choice of the old "septenary" measure,
in which most of the dialogue is written, may have been due to
recollection of the Terentian iambic tetrameter catalectic, just as the
rugged Alexandrines of <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> were probably suggested
by the Latin comic senarius. But while in Udall's play the matter
as well as the form is largely of classical origin, the plot and the
characters of <i>Gammer Gurtons Nedle</i> are purely native. Its material
is drawn at first hand from observation of English life; its literary
ancestry, so far as it has any, is mainly to be traced through John
Heywood's interludes to the farces of the fifteenth-century mysteries,
of which one brilliant example is preserved in the <i>Secunda Pastorum</i>
of the Towneley cycle.</p>

<p>The artistic merit of the piece has often been unduly depreciated,
from causes which it is not difficult to understand. The very rudimentary
kind of humour which turns on physically disgusting suggestions
is no longer amusing to educated people, and there is so
much of this poor stuff in the play that the real wit of some scenes,
and the clever portraiture of character throughout, have not received
their fair share of acknowledgment. Most people who have lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
long in an English village will recognise Gammer Gurton and Dame
Chat as capital studies from life, though their modern representatives
are not quite so foul-mouthed in their wrath as the gossips of
the sixteenth century; and Hodge, whose name has become the
conventional designation of the English farm labourer, is an equally
lifelike figure. The brightly drawn character of Diccon represents
a type which the working of the poor laws, and many social changes,
have banished from our villages. But old people who were living
down to the middle of this century had many stories to tell of the
crazy wanderer, who was recognised as too feather-brained to be
set to any useful work, but who was a welcome guest in cottage
homes, and whose pranks were looked on with kindly toleration by
well-disposed people, even when they led to inconvenient consequences.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
The game of cross-purposes brought about by Diccon's
machinations, which forms the plot, is humorously imagined, and
worked out with some skill. It does not, of course, rise above the
level of farce; but there is real comedy, not quite of the lowest
order, in the scene where the fussy self-importance of Dr. Rat, bursting
with impotent rage at his well-merited discomfiture, is confronted
with the calm impartiality of "Master Baily"&mdash;the steward of the
lord of the manor, apparently, and the representative of temporal
authority in the village. The common verdict that <i>Gammer Gurtons
Nedle</i> is a work of lower rank than <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i> is
perhaps on the whole not unjust; but the later play has some merits
of its own, and, as the first known attempt to present a picture of
contemporary rustic life in the form of a regular comedy, it may be
admitted to represent a distinct advance in the development of
English dramatic art.</p>

<p><b>Dialect.</b>&mdash;The treatment of dialect in the play demands a word
of notice. All the characters, except the curate and the baily, who
belong to the educated class, and Diccon, who may be presumed to
have come down from a better social station than that of the village
people, use a kind of speech which is clearly intended to represent the
dialect of the southwestern counties. It is not always very correct;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>the writer, for instance, seems to have thought that <i>cham</i> stood for
"am" as well as "I am," so that he makes Hodge say "cham I
not." Stevenson, as we have seen, was of northern birth; and, as
a line or two in the same dialect is found in <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>,
there is some reason for believing that the dialect of the stage rustic
was already a matter of established convention.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The word <i>pes</i>, a
hassock, which occurs in the play, is peculiar, so far as is known, to
the East Anglian dialect, and may have been picked up by the author
in his walks about Cambridge. Whether derived from <i>Gammer
Gurton</i> or from plays of earlier date, the conventional dialect of
the stage rustic kept its place throughout the Elizabethan period.
Shakspere's rustics, as is well known, mostly use the southwestern
forms, not those current in the poet's native Warwickshire.</p>

<p><b>The Present Text.</b>&mdash;The text of the present edition is taken from
the copy of Colwell's edition (1575) in the Bodleian Library. The
original spelling has been preserved, except that <i>j</i> and <i>v</i> are substituted
for <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> when used as consonants, and <i>u</i> for <i>v</i> when used
as a vowel. Obvious misprints have been corrected, but are mentioned
in the footnotes (except in the case of mere errors of word-division,
which it seemed unnecessary to notice). The punctuation,
and the use of initial capitals, have been conformed to modern practice.
Another copy of Colwell's edition is in the British Museum.
The play was reprinted in 1661, and, with modernised spelling, in
Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>, and in the new edition of Dodsley by W. C.
Hazlitt. An excellent edition, with the original spelling, was published
in 1897 by Professor J. M. Manly, in vol. ii. of his <i>Specimens
of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama</i>. Several of the readings which are
given in Professor Manly's text or footnotes as those of Colwell's
edition do not agree with those either of the London or the Oxford
copy. In the footnotes to the present edition reference to Colwell's,
Hazlitt's, and Manly's editions are indicated by Ed. 1575, H. and
M., respectively.</p>

APPENDIX </h2>

<p>The song at the beginning of the second act exists in an older and better
version, which was printed by Dyce (from a Ms. in his own possession) in
his edition of Skelton's <i>Works</i>, Vol. I, p. vii. It is not likely that the date
of the composition is much older than the middle of the sixteenth century,
and it may possibly be later. The following copy is taken from Dyce, but
the punctuation and the capitals have been adjusted in accordance with the

 CRITICAL ESSAY </h3>

<p><b>Life.</b>&mdash;John Lyly was born in Kent between October 8, 1553, and
January, 1554. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, 1569, but was
almost immediately rusticated. Returning in October, 1571, he was graduated
B.A. April 27, 1573. In May, 1574, he wrote unsuccessfully to
Lord Burleigh, begging for a fellowship at Magdalen. He proceeded M.A.
June 1, 1575, and lived mainly at the Universities till 1579. <i>Euphues,
the Anatomie of Wit</i>, appeared between December, 1578, and spring, 1579.
Another edition was printed in 1579; twelve others before 1637. In <i>An
Address to the Gentlemen Scholars of Oxford</i>, prefixed to the second, the
1579, edition, he answered a charge of having unfairly criticised Oxford in
the <i>Anatomie of Wit</i>. A sequel, <i>Euphues and his England</i>, was licensed
July 24, 1579, but did not appear for months. Probably Lyly shared in
the disfavour which, from late July, 1579, to July, 1580, the Queen showed
the party of Robert Dudley because of his secret marriage with the Countess
of Essex. <i>Endimion</i>, probably the first of Lyly's extant comedies, was presented
between late July and early November, 1579, as an allegorical treatment
of this quarrel. In or near July, 1580, Lyly was "entertained as
servant" by the Queen, and was advised to aim at the Mastership of the
Revels. By July, 1582, he is to be found in the household of Lord Burleigh.
A letter of his was prefixed to Watson's <i>Passionate Centurie of Love</i>,
published 1582. By 1589, possibly earlier, he had become vice-master of
St. Paul's choir school. Before 1584 the Chapel Children and the Paul's
Boys, for whom he had written, ceased to act. During 1584 his <i>Sapho and
Phao</i>, written not long after February 6, 1582, and his <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i>
were printed. <i>Tityrus and Gallathea</i>, licensed in 1584, was not
printed till 1592. Probably the main plot was written before 1584, and
the sub-plot for a revision of the play in or near 1588. From 1585 Lyly
wrote for the Paul's Boys till in or near 1591, when the company was
again silent. The Chapel Children were not acting publicly between November,
1584, and 1597. His <i>Mydas</i> was acted between August, 1588,
and November, 1589, and printed in 1592. In August or September,
1589, a pamphlet entitled <i>Pappe-with-an-Hatchet</i>, written by him for the
High Church party in the Marprelate controversy, made its appearance. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
<i>Mother Bombie</i> was acted in 1589 or 1590, and printed in 1594. <i>Alexander
and Campaspe</i> and <i>Sapho and Phao</i> were reprinted in 1591, and in the
same year <i>Endimion</i> was printed. <i>Gallathea</i> appeared in 1592. Lyly
wrote, in 1590 or 1591, an apparently unsuccessful begging letter to the
Queen, and another in 1593 or 1594. He was married by 1589, and he
had two sons and one daughter. He was member of Parliament for Hindon
in 1589; for Aylesbury in 1593 and 1601; and for Appleby in 1597.
<i>The Woman in the Moone</i> was licensed in 1595, printed in 1597. The
quality of the blank verse in this play and the absence of marked Euphuism
favour a date of composition in or near 1590. <i>Lillie's Light</i> was licensed
June 3, 1596. If printed, it is non-extant. He wrote prefatory Latin
lines for Henry Lock's <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, otherwise called <i>The Preacher</i>, in 1597.
In 1597-1600 the Chapel Children revived his plays. The <i>Maid's Metamorphosis</i>,
incorrectly attributed to Lyly, was printed in 1600. His <i>Love's
Metamorphosis</i> was printed in 1601: it had been written about the time of
the <i>Gallathea</i>,&mdash;before 1584, or between 1588 and 1591. The Protea-Petulius
part is probably from a different play, or is a survival in a revision.
Lyly died November 30, 1606, and was buried at St. Bartholomew's.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Place of Euphues in English Literature.</b>&mdash;John Lyly was poet,
pamphleteer, novelist, and dramatist. As a pamphleteer he is unimportant.
As a poet he can best be studied in his plays. It is,
then, as novelist and dramatist that he is important. The material
of the two parts of the <i>Euphues</i> makes it decidedly significant in its
own time. It is not, like most of the stories of Greene and Lodge,
mere romance, nor, like Nash's <i>Jack Wilton</i>, a tale of adventure
phrased with reportorial recklessness. It is a love story in which
romance is subordinated to the inculcation of ideas of high living
and thinking, and the demands of an involved style. It dimly foreshadows
two literary products which reach a development only long
after the days of Elizabeth&mdash;the novel with a purpose, and the
stylistic novel. The appearance of the book was epochal. Young
writers of the day&mdash;Munday, Greene, Nash, and Lodge&mdash;copied
its style. Courtiers patterned their speech upon it. Yet Gabriel
Harvey was probably right when he ill-naturedly wrote: "Young
Euphues but hatched the egges that his elder freendes laide." The
<i>Anatomie</i>, at least, is such a book as a recent university graduate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>the present day, well read in some of the classics, and especially
susceptible to new literary influences and cults, might compile. In
the division <i>Euphues and His Ephœbus</i> Lyly uses, with a few omissions
and additions, Plutarch on <i>Education</i>; in the letter to Botonio
he translates Plutarch on <i>Exile</i>. In the part <i>Euphues and Atheos</i> he
is indebted to chapters 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the <i>Dial of Princes</i>
(1529) by Antonio de Guevara, Bishop of Guadix and Mendoza.
Euphues and Lucilla debate "dubii," or artificial discussions of set
questions, such as one finds in Hortensio Lando or Castiglione.
There is, too, almost constant use of the unnatural natural history
of Pliny. All this material is bound together by a style which,
though it may ultimately be traced to the rounded periods of
Cicero, had developed slowly in writers of the Renaissance and the
years just before <i>Euphues</i> appeared. George Pettie, for instance,
in his <i>Pettie Palace of Pettie His Pleasure</i>, published in 1576, has
all the stylistic characteristics of the <i>Euphues</i> except the fabulous
natural history. It is, however, to Guevara in the <i>Dial of Princes</i>
that Lyly is thought to be particularly indebted for his style. This
man used "lavishly the well-known figures of pointed antithesis
and parisonic balanced clauses, in connection with a general climactic
structure of the sentence or period, the emphatic or antithetic
words being marked by rhyme or assonance." Lyly substitutes for
rhyme alliteration, and adds persistent play on words. The book
is genuinely Renaissance, then, for, looking to classic literature for
much of its substance, it expresses itself in a style that typifies an
intellectual mood of the hour.</p>

<p><b>Lyly's Plays: their Subdivision.</b>&mdash;Just before 1580 the acting of
choir boys was in great favour with the Queen and, as a consequence,
with the public. The boys of Westminster, Windsor, the
Chapel Royal, and St. Paul's were often summoned to court. For
the last two companies, with whom acting became a profession,
Lyly wrote his plays. These divide into four classes. The allegorical
comedies, in which what is alluded to is as important as
what is said, are <i>Endimion</i>, <i>Sapho and Phao</i>, and <i>Mydas</i>. <i>Endimion</i>,
perhaps the most complete example of Lyly's allegorical comedy,
presents the apology of Leicester to the Queen for his secret marriage
with Lettice, Countess of Essex. <i>Sapho and Phao</i> is full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
allusions to the coquetting of the Queen with the Duc d'Alençon
and his wrathful departure from England in February, 1582. <i>Mydas</i>
allegorises&mdash;though with less detail than the others&mdash;as to the
designs of Philip II. on the English throne, and the Spanish
Armada. <i>Gallathea</i>, <i>Love's Metamorphosis</i>, and <i>The Woman in the
Moone</i> form a second class&mdash;pastoral comedies. They are allegorical
only when some figure is given qualities which the Queen
was fond of hearing praised as hers. <i>Mother Bombie</i>, standing
alone as a comedy on the model of Plautus, has a much more involved
plot than any of the other plays. Finally, also in a class
by itself, is <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i>.</p>

<p>In this, as in all the comedies except <i>Mother Bombie</i> and <i>Love's
Metamorphosis</i>, Lyly used classic myth for his chief material. Yet
he but followed a custom of the day, for most of the plays given
at court between 1570 and 1590 by the children's companies were
based on such material: for instance, <i>Iphigenia</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Alcmæon</i>,
<i>Quintus Fabius</i>, and <i>Scipio Africanus</i>. These subjects seem to have
been treated as pastorals, histories, and possibly allegories. Lyly
rejected in <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i> the allegorical and the pastoral
form, and told rather naïvely, except in style, the story of the love
of Alexander and Apelles for Campaspe, repeating in his sub-plot
many historic retorts of Diogenes. In details of method Lyly
seems to have had a precursor. Richard Edwardes (born 1523, died
1566) in his <i>Damon and Pythias</i>, printed in 1582, but usually
assigned to 1564, wrote in a way very suggestive of Lyly in <i>Alexander
and Campaspe</i>. He disclaimed in his prologue intention of
referring to any court except that of Dionysius at Syracuse; introduced
lyrics; gave Aristippus the philosopher an important place;
inveighed against flattery at the court; brought in the comic
episode of Grim the collier without connection with the main plot,
just as Lyly often introduces his comic material; and derived the
fun of this scene mainly from two impudent pages. Certainly it
would have been natural for Lyly, early in his career, to look to
the plays of a former prominent master of the Chapel Children.</p>

<p><b>Alexander and Campaspe: Date, Sources.</b>&mdash;The exact date of
<i>Alexander and Campaspe</i> it seems impossible to determine. It
was written before April, 1584, for it was licensed for printing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
that month. The facts that similes and references in <i>Euphues</i> are
found in it, and that the work&mdash;here of a kind which Lyly never
exactly repeats&mdash;resembles the early <i>Damon and Pythias</i> suggest
that <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i> belongs early in his dramatic career.
It has been held that it should precede <i>Endimion</i>, but the allegory in
that play; the fact that Blount, who places <i>Sapho and Phao</i>, <i>Gallathea</i>,
<i>Mydas</i>, and <i>Mother Bombie</i> in the order approved by the most
recent criticism, puts it second; and the better characterization,
more natural dialogue, and slightly closer binding together of the
main and the sub-plot, argue for the second place.</p>

<p>The play, like the <i>Anatomie of Wit</i>, is a composite. The main
plot&mdash;the story of Apelles and Campaspe&mdash;Lyly found in Book
35 of Pliny's <i>History of the World</i>. His setting he took from
Plutarch's <i>Life of Alexander</i>. That, too, gave him the siege of
Thebes, Timoclea, some of the philosophers' names, most of their
speeches, the generals, and Hephestion, and probably suggested the
possibilities of Diogenes as a comic figure. The material for the
scenes of the Cynic, and the name Manes, he found in the <i>Lives
of the Philosophers</i> by Diogenes Laertius.</p>

<p><b>Literary Estimate.</b>&mdash;In the extant plays from 1550 to 1580 love
has but a subordinate part. In <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i>, however, as
in all the Lyly comedies, the central idea is that of nearly all the
great plays of the Elizabethan drama&mdash;the love of man for woman.
Doubtless the subject appealed to Lyly especially because in the self-abnegation
of Alexander the Queen might choose to see a compliment
to her final position toward Leicester and the Countess of Essex.
Diogenes he used in order to get comic relief. That Lyly's comedies
are comparatively free from vulgarity is probably because they
were given by children before the Queen and her ladies. Possibly
the youth of the actors is the reason for the absence of strong
emotional expression, but it is more probable that the temperament
of the author is responsible. It is hard to believe that a dramatist
who felt keenly emotional possibilities in his material could have
passed by Timoclea so rapidly, for in Plutarch she has all the
requisites of the heroine in a Beaumont and Fletcher play. Nor
would such a dramatist have made so little of the struggle of Alexander
between infatuation and the desire to regain his accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
self-command. Lyly's position toward his work is like that of the
early writers of chronicle-history plays. He does not depend on
selecting the most characteristic situations and speeches, on supplying
missing motives, on unification of material which history has
passed down in somewhat disordered fashion, but on repeating as
many as possible of the situations and speeches associated with the
names. Like those writers, too, he makes no attempt to get
behind his material, to see its interrelations and its dramatic significance
as a whole.</p>

<p>Some allowance, however, must be made for faults in this play,
for the Prologue states that it was hastily written. The comedy
itself shows that Lyly planned as he wrote. The opening scene
of the play leaves one to suppose that Timoclea, who, rather
than Campaspe, is the chief female speaker, is to play an important
part. She never appears again, and is mentioned but once.
Later parts of the play call for some manifestation, in this first
scene, of Campaspe's intense fascination for Alexander, but there
is nothing of the kind. Nor does the action in any later scene
really prepare for Alexander's self-reproaches for his mad infatuation.
Until late in the play, when Lyly speaks of Campaspe
as Alexander's concubine, a reader is not even entirely clear as
to their relations. Perhaps some of this lack of clearness and
sequence may result because the Timoclea part, at least, of the
first scene is a survival from an older play. In the <i>Accounts of the
Revels at Court</i>, under an entry for expenditures between January
and February, 1573(4), "One Playe showen at Hampton Coorte
before her Maᵗⁱᵉ by Mr. Munkester's Children" (Mulcaster's of
the Merchant Taylors' School) is mentioned. Interlined are the
words: "Timoclia at the Sege of Thebes by Alexander."</p>

<p>The movement of the comedy is episodic. The clever little
pages bind the scenes together; Alexander connects the incidents
of the main story; but too often, especially in the sub-plot, the
action is not prepared for, and does not lead to anything. Nor
does Lyly care much for climax. The Diogenes sub-plot does not
end; it is dropped just before the main story closes. The great
dramatic possibilities of the final scene are practically thrown away.
It is significant that they could be developed only by a hand which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
could paint vividly the contest of a soul, the gradual reascendency
of old motives, and manly renunciation.</p>

<p>Growth in character Lyly does not understand. As a rule his
figures are types rather than many-sided human beings. Nor are
the types always self-consistent. All the nobility of Alexander's
renunciation disappears when he says: "Go, Apelles, take with
you your Campaspe; Alexander is cloyed with looking on that
which thou wond'rest at." In general, Lyly is too ready to depend
on the way in which his figures speak rather than on truth to life
in what they speak. In the retorts of Apelles as he talks with
Alexander of his work, there is, of course, something of the real
artist's pride in his art and irritation at royal omniscience. There
is characterization, too, in many of the speeches of Diogenes, but
in both of these instances Lyly is either quoting or paraphrasing.
Campaspe, it is true, is almost a character, and slightly anticipates
the arch heroines of Shakespeare. Hers are coquettishness,
womanly charm. In her scene with Apelles in the studio (Act IV.
scene 2), the underlying passion of both almost breaks through the
frigid medium of expression. The pages may doubtless be traced
back to the witty, graceless slaves of Latin comedy, and more
immediately to precursors in the work of Edwardes, but Lyly adds
so much individuality and humour that they are a real accession in
the history of the drama. Moreover, many of his figures often
comment incisively on customs and follies of the time, preparing
for the later comedy of manners.</p>

<p>No preceding play is so full of charming and lasting lyrics.
In all his comedies except <i>The Woman in the Moone</i>, Lyly writes
neither in the usual jingling rhymes nor the infrequently used
blank verse, but in prose. He shows the men of his day new
possibilities in dialogue; for though his artificial style prevents easy
characterisation, it does not keep him from effective repartee and a
closer representation of the give and take of real conversation than
was possible with the rhyming lines, or with blank verse as it was
handled in his day. Probably, however, the greatest importance
of this play for the student of Elizabethan drama is the way it
shows interest in a romantic story breaking through classic material
and Renaissance expression, thus anticipating the romantic drama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of 1587. Clearly, then, the merits of <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i> are
literary and historical, not dramatic.</p>

<p><b>Lyly's Development as a Dramatist.</b>&mdash;That Lyly worked, however,
steadily toward more genuine drama becomes clear if one
reads his plays in order. In all he shows classical influence by his
choice of subject, or by constant allusion, but he is not a scholar
in the sense of Jonson or Chapman. He is well read in certain
authors&mdash;Ovid, particularly the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Plutarch, Pliny,
perhaps Lucian; he has at his tongue's end many stock Latin quotations,
and delights in misquoting or paraphrasing for the sake of
a pun, sure that the quick-witted courtiers will recognize the originals.
Classical in construction he certainly is not. His interest
is to find a pretty love story which gives opportunities for dramatic
surprises and complications, effective groupings, graceful dances, and
dainty lyrics. He is fertile in finding interesting figures to bring
upon the stage&mdash;the fairies of <i>Endimion</i>, the fiddlers of <i>Mother Bombie</i>,
the shepherds of <i>Love's Metamorphosis</i>. If one examines the only
two plays of his which lack the contrasting comic under-plot,&mdash;<i>Love's
Metamorphosis</i>, and <i>The Woman in the Moone</i>,&mdash;it becomes
clear that they are pastorals or masques. Even the other plays owe
to their sub-plots the right to be called comedies. By choice of
topics and by temperament, then, Lyly is a writer of masques.</p>

<p>At first he developed his two plots side by side, as in <i>Endimion</i>.
One is used simply to relieve the other, or to fill time-spaces necessary
between incidents of the main plot. Later, he joins the two
slightly by letting figures in the sub-plot refer to incidents of the
main story. In <i>Mother Bombie</i> he brings the groups together formally
two or three times, and closes the play with nearly all the
characters on the stage. In his last comedy, <i>The Woman in the
Moone</i>, he discards contrasted plots, and tries to get his effects from
one large group of figures. Even if his success in meeting his
problem is not great, the mere recognition of it is significant. Yet
it cannot be said that he ever becomes a good plotter, for he is
always willing to bring in anywhere new people, new interests, or
even, as in <i>Mydas</i>, to shift to a new plot midway. In <i>Mother Bombie</i>,
when the climax of complication is reached in the meeting of
the disguised Accius and Silena and their fathers, Lyly is unable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
master the difficulties of the situation. He lets the two reveal
themselves tamely, confusingly, before he has had anything like the
potential fun out of the scene. Usually the plays ramble gently on
till Lyly thinks the audience must have enough; then the <i>deus ex
machina</i> appears, and all ends. Climax in closing he seems not to
try for, but is content to end with a telling phrase.</p>

<p>In characterization his work varies. In the allegories he wishes
merely to suggest well-known figures; distinct, final characterization
would be out of place, even dangerous. In the pastoral-masques,
the land of fantasy, the lines of characterization need not
be sharply drawn. But even if one looks at <i>Mother Bombie</i> and the
sub-plots of the plays, one sees that though there is perhaps a slight
gain in portraying the figures, the people are too often significant
for the way in which they talk rather than for action or characterizing
speech. When Lyly attempts strong presentation of
crucial moments or pathos, he stammers, or is particularly conventional.</p>

<p>As he develops, he modifies the eccentricities of his style. Nor is
it probable that the passing of the popular enthusiasm for Euphuism
is wholly responsible for this. He had the good sense to see the
superiority of prose to verse as the expression of comedy, and he
must have felt how much his rigidly artificial style cramped him.
In <i>Mother Bombie</i>, 1589-91, Euphuism is well-nigh gone. In its
place we have a style in which characterized dialogue is more
possible and more evident. In <i>The Woman in the Moone</i> the exigencies
of verse are too much for Euphuism, and it practically
disappears.</p>

<p>Very slowly, then, Lyly was working toward a drama of simple
characterizing dialogue, more unified, and at the same time more
complex. Even as he worked, however, Kyd, Greene, and Marlowe
swept by to accomplishment impossible for him under any
conditions.</p>

<p><b>His Place in English Comedy.</b>&mdash;John Lyly is not merely, then,
as has been too often suggested, a scholar "picking fancies out of
books (with) little else to marvel at." He was keenly alive to foreign
and domestic influences at work about him. His use of what
other men offer foreshadows the marvellous assimilative power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Shakespeare. He seems to retain and apply with freedom all the
similes and illustrations that come in his way; many are not to be
hunted down except in out-of-the-way corners of the books best
known to him. Only a man of poetic feeling would have cared to
work in these allegories and pastorals. Humorous he is in the scenes
of the pages. Here and there, as in some of the replies of Apelles
to Alexander, and in the words of Parmenio on the rising sun (Act I,
scene 1), there is caustic irony. Lyly is a thinker, too, and a critic,
as his frequent satire of existing social customs or follies shows.
Now and then he is fearless; for instance, in his portrayal before
the Queen of the artist's contempt for royal assumption of knowledge
(Act III, scene 4), and in his comment on the impossibility of
happy love between a subject and a monarch (Act IV, scene 4). His
allegories show best his ingenuity and inventiveness. His mastery
of involved phrasing is indubitable.</p>

<p>Without doubt, however, his attitude toward his work is more
that of the scholar than the poet or dramatist. His work is imitation
of others who seem to him models, with the main attention on
style. He has the inventiveness of the dramatist, but not his instinct
for technique or recognition of the possibilities of a story and
care in working them out. He never says a thing for himself if he
can find it anywhere in a recognized author. In this, however, he
shared in the mood of Spenser and his group. Indeed, a little comparison
of Lyly with Spenser will show that, though in accomplishment
he is far below the poet, he expresses in his comedies the
historical influences, the existing intellectual conditions, and the
literary aspirations which Spenser phrases in his early work. It is
in poetic power, in imaginative sweep, that the two separate
widely.</p>

<p>Yet Lyly, drawing on what preceded and what surrounded him,
did more than express the literary mood and desires of his day.
Through him the lyric in the drama came to Dekker, Jonson, and
Shakespeare, more dainty and more varied. He broke the way for
later men to use prose as the means of expression for comedy. He
gave them suggestions for clever dialogue. At a time of loose and
hurried dramatic writing he showed that literary finish might well
accompany such composition. His pages are the prototypes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
boys and servants in Peele, Chapman, Jonson, and Shakespeare. In
a small way he foreshadowed the comedy of manners. For as close
a relationship between the drama and politics as we find in his allegories,
we must look to the declining days of the Jacobean drama&mdash;to
Middleton's <i>Game of Chess</i>. The romantic spirit found expression
in him, not in a drama of blood, but in pastorals and masques
which look forward to the masques of Jonson, to <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>,
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and <i>As You Like It</i>. His influence on
the highly sensitized mind of Shakespeare may be traced in many
lines and scenes.</p>

<p>His vogue as a dramatist was short. By 1590 the boisterous,
romantic drama, the often inchoate chronicle history, both frequently
accompanied by scenes of would-be comic horse-play, engrossed
public attention. The great period of experimentation with both old
and crude forms was beginning. It is not surprising that when
Lyly's plays were revived by the Chapel Children in 1597-1600,
they could not stand comparison with the work of Jonson, Dekker,
Heywood, and other dramatists of the day, but were called "musty
fopperies of antiquity." Their work, in bridging from the classic
to romantic comedy, as the Drama of Blood bridged from Seneca to
real tragedy, was done. Thereafter their main interest must be
historical.</p>

<p><b>Previous Editions and the Present Text.</b>&mdash;The title of the first
quarto (1584) is, "A moste excellent Comedie of Alexander, Campaspe,
and Diogenes, played before the Queene's Maiestie on twelfe
day at night, by her Maiestie's Children, and the Children of Paules.
Imprinted at London, for Thomas Cadman, 1584." In the second
edition, issued the same year by the same publisher, the title is
changed to <i>Campaspe</i>, and the play is said to have been given "on
new yeares day at night." The title, <i>Campaspe</i>, was retained in the
third quarto, 1591, for William Broome, and in Edward Blount's
duodecimo collective edition, 1632. (Manly.) Both, too, state that
the play was given "on twelfe-day at night." The headlines of
all the quartos read <i>Alexander and Campaspe</i>; of Blount, <i>A tragicall
Comedie of Alexander and Campaspe</i>. Besides the quartos and Blount's
<i>Sixe Court Comedies</i> there are these reprints: in Vol. II., Dodsley's
<i>Select Collection of Old Plays</i>, 1825; in Vol. I., <i>John Lilly's Dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Works</i>, F. W. Fairholt, 1858; in Vol. II., <i>Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean
Drama</i>, J. M. Manly, 1897. In the footnotes of the
present edition the quartos are indicated by A. B. and C., the other
editions by Bl. Do. F. and M. respectively. Blount's text, mainly,
is followed. The variant readings of the quartos are given on the
authority of Fairholt.</p>

<i>LYTUS.</i> Parmenio, I cannot tell whether I should more
commend in Alexanders victories courage, or courtesie,
in the one being a resolution without feare, in the other
a liberalitie above custome. Thebes is razed, the people
not racked; towers throwne downe, bodies not thrust aside; a conquest <span class="linenum">5</span>
without conflict, and a cruell warre in a milde peace.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Clytus, it becommeth the sonne of Philip to bee none other
than Alexander is; therefore, seeing in the father a full perfection,
who could have doubted in the sonne an excellency? For, as the
moone can borrow nothing else of the sunne but light,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> so of a sire
<span class="linenum">10</span>
in whom nothing but vertue was what could the childe receive but
singular?<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> It is for turkies to staine each other, not for diamonds;
in the one to bee made a difference in goodnesse, in the other no
comparison.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
<i>Clytus.</i> You mistake mee, Parmenio, if, whilest I commend Alexander,
<span class="linenum">15</span>
you imagine I call Philip into question; unlesse, happily,
you conjecture (which none of judgement will conceive) that because
I like the fruit, therefore I heave at the tree, or, coveting to
kisse the childe, I therefore goe about to poyson the teat.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> I, but, Clytus, I perceive you are borne in the east, and
<span class="linenum">20</span>
never laugh but at the sunne rising;<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> which argueth, though a dutie
where you ought, yet no great devotion where you might.</p>
<p>
<i>Clytus.</i> We will make no controversie of that [of]<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> which there
ought to be no question; onely this shall be the opinion of us both,
that none was worthy to be the father of Alexander but Philip, nor
<span class="linenum">25</span>
any meete to be the sonne of Philip but Alexander.
</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter Soldiers with</i> <span class="smcap">Timoclea</span>, <span class="smcap">Campaspe</span>, <i>other captives, and spoils</i>.]</p>

<p>
<i>Par.</i> Soft, Clytus, behold the spoiles and prisoners! A pleasant
sight to us, because profit is joyned with honour; not much painfull
to them, because their captivitie is eased by mercie.</p>

<p>
<i>Timo.</i> [<i>aside</i>].  Fortune, thou didst never yet deceive vertue,      <span class="linenum">30</span>
because vertue never yet did trust fortune! Sword and fire will
never get spoyle where wisdome and fortitude beares sway. O
Thebes, thy wals were raised by the sweetnesse of the harpe,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> but
rased by the shrilnes of the trumpet! Alexander had never come
so neer the wals, had Epaminondas walkt about the wals; and yet       <span class="linenum">35</span>
might the Thebanes have beene merry in their streets, if hee had
beene to watch their towers. But destinie is seldome forseene,
never prevented. We are here now captives, whose neckes are
voaked by force, but whose hearts cannot yeeld by death.&mdash;Come
Campaspe and the rest, let us not be ashamed to cast our eyes on      <span class="linenum">40</span>
him on whom we feared not to cast our darts.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Madame, you need not doubt;<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> it is Alexander that is the
conquerour.</p>

<p><i>Timo.</i> Alexander hath overcome, not conquered.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> To bring all under his subjection is to conquer.
<span class="linenum">45</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
<i>Timo.</i> He cannot subdue that which is divine.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Thebes was not.</p>

<p><i>Timo.</i> Vertue is.</p>

<p><i>Clytus.</i> Alexander, as hee tendreth<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> vertue, so hee will you. Hee
drinketh not bloud, but thirsteth after honour; hee is greedie of           <span class="linenum">50</span>
victorie, but never satisfied with mercie; in fight terrible, as becommeth
a captaine; in conquest milde, as beseemeth a king; in all
things<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> than which nothing can be greater, hee is Alexander.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Then, if it be such a thing to be Alexander, I hope it
shall be no miserable thing to be a virgin.  For, if hee save our      <span class="linenum">55</span>
honours, it is more than to restore our goods; and rather doe I wish
he preserve our fame than our lives: which if he doe, we will confesse
there can be no greater thing than to be Alexander.

<p><i>Alex.</i> I will know.  Madam, of whence you are I know, but

<p><i>Timo.</i> Alexander, I am the sister of Theagines, who fought a      <span class="linenum">65</span>

<i>Alex.</i> Well, ladies, for so your vertues shew you, whatsoever
your births be, you shall be honorably entreated. Athens shall be      <span class="linenum">75</span>
your Thebes; and you shall not be as abjects of warre, but as subjects

the citie; charge the souldiers not so much as in words to offer
them any offence; and let all wants bee supplied so farre forth as
shall be necessarie for such persons and my prisoners.                <span class="linenum">80</span>

<p><i>Gran.</i> Manes, it is pitie so proper a man should be cast away

<p><i>Manes.</i> You may see how dull a fasting wit is: therefore, Psyllus,
let us goe to supper with Granichus. Plato is the best fellow of all
philosophers: give me him that reades<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> in the morning in the

schoole, and at noone in the kitchen.</p>

<p><i>Psyllus.</i> And me!</p>

<p><i>Gran.</i> Ah, sirs, my master is a king in his parlour for the body,
and a god in his studie for the soule.  Among all his men he commendeth
one that is an excellent musition; then stand I by and clap           <span class="linenum">50</span>
another on the shoulder and say, "This is a passing good cooke."</p>

<p><i>Manes.</i> It is well done Granichus; for give mee pleasure that
goes in at the mouth, not the eare,&mdash;I had rather fill my guts
than my braines.</p>

<p><i>Psyllus.</i> I serve Apelles, who feedeth mee as Diogenes doth      <span class="linenum">55</span>
Manes; for at dinner the one preacheth abstinence, the other commendeth
counterfaiting<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>: when I would eate meate, he paints a<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>

and pointes to a table<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> which containes the Banquet of the Gods,
where are many dishes to feed the eye, but not to fill the gut.       <span class="linenum">60</span>
</p>
<p><i>Gran.</i> What doest thou then?</p>

<p><i>Psyllus.</i> This doth hee then: bring in many examples that some
have lived by savours; and proveth that much easier it is to fat by
colours; and telles of birdes that have been fatted by painted grapes
in winter, and how many have so fed their eyes with their mistresse       <span class="linenum">65</span>
picture that they never desired to take food, being glutted
with the delight in their favours.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Then doth he shew me counterfeites,&mdash;such
as have surfeited, with their filthy and lothsome vomites;
and the riotous<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Bacchanalls of the god Bacchus and his
disorderly crew; which are painted all to the life in his shop. To       <span class="linenum">70</span>
conclude, I fare hardly, though I goe richly, which maketh me
when I should begin to shadow a ladies face, to draw a lambs head,
and sometime to set to the body of a maid a shoulder of mutton,

nought but sentences to fill my maw: as, <i>Plures occidit crapula quam

old saw of abstinence by<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Socrates,&mdash;The belly is the heads grave.

<i>Melip.</i> I had never such adoe to warne schollers to come before
a king! First I came to Crisippus, a tall, leane old mad man,
willing him presently to appeare before Alexander. Hee stood staring
on my face, neither moving his eyes nor his body. I urging
him to give some answer, hee tooke up a booke, sate downe, and         <span class="linenum">5</span>
saide nothing. Melissa, his maide, told mee it was his manner, and
that oftentimes shee was fain to thrust meat into his mouth, for that
he would rather sterve than cease studie. Well, thought I, seeing
bookish men are so blockish and great clearkes such simple courtiers,
I will neither be partaker of their commons nor their commendations.        <span class="linenum">10</span>
From thence I came to Plato and to Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> and to divers
other; none refusing to come, saving an olde, obscure fellow, who,
sitting in a tub turned towardes the sunne, read Greeke to a young
boy. Him when I willed to appeare before Alexander, he answered,
"If Alexander would faine see mee, let him come to mee; if learne        <span class="linenum">15</span>
of me, let him come to mee; whatsoever it be, let him come to
me." "Why," said I, "he is a king." He answered, "Why,
I am a philosopher." "Why, but he is Alexander." "I, but
I am Diogenes." I was halfe angry to see one so crooked in
his shape to bee so crabbed in his sayings; so, going my way,         <span class="linenum">20</span>
I said, "Thou shalt repent it, if thou comest not to Alexander."
"Nay," smiling answered hee, "Alexander may repent it if hee
come not to Diogenes: vertue must bee sought, not offered."
And so, turning himselfe to his cell, hee grunted I know not what,
like a pig under a tub. But I must bee gone, the philosophers are        <span class="linenum">25</span>
comming. </p>

<p>
<i>Plato.</i> It is a difficult controversie, Aristotle, and rather to be
wondred at than beleeved, how natural causes should worke supernaturall
effects.</p>

<p><i>Aris.</i> I do not so much stand upon the apparition is seene in the      <span class="linenum">30</span>
moone,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> neither the <i>Demonium</i> of Socrates, as that I cannot by
naturall reason give any reason of the ebbing and flowing of the
sea; which makes me in the depth of my studies to crie out, <i>O ens
entium, miserere mei</i>.</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> Cleanthes and you attribute so much to nature by searching      <span class="linenum">35</span>
for things which are not to be found, that, whilest you studie a
cause of your owne,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> you omitt the occasion it selfe.  There is no
man so savage in whom resteth not this divine particle: that there is
an omnipotent, eternall, and divine mover, which may be called God.</p>

<p><i>Cleant.</i> I am of this minde: that that first mover, which you      <span class="linenum">40</span>
terme God, is the instrument of all the movings which we attribute
to nature.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> The earth, which is masse, swimmeth<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> on the sea,
seasons divided in themselves, fruits growing in themselves, the

else appeareth miraculous,&mdash;what man almost of meane                     <span class="linenum">45</span>
capacitie but can prove it natural?</p>

<p><i>Anax.</i> These causes shall be debated at our philosophers feast,
in which controversie I will take part with Aristotle that there is
<i>Natura naturans</i>,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> and yet not God.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>

<span class="linenum">55</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> But I much mervaile Diogenes should bee so dogged.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> I doe not thinke but his excuse will be better than Melippus message.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I will goe see him, Hephestion, because I long to see him
that would command Alexander to come, to whom all the world is           <span class="linenum">60</span>
like to come.&mdash;Aristotle and the rest, sithence my comming from
Thebes to Athens, from a place of conquest to a pallace of<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> quiet,
I have resolved with my selfe in my court to have as many philosophers
as I had in my camp souldiers.  My court shal be a schoole
wherein I wil have used as great doctrine<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> in peace as I did in
<span class="linenum">65</span>
warre discipline.</p>

<p><i>Aris.</i> We are all here ready to be commanded, and glad we are
that we are commanded, for that nothing better becommeth kings
than literature, which maketh them come as neare to the gods in
wisdome as they doe in dignitie.                                      <span class="linenum">70</span>
</p>
<p><i>Alex.</i> It is so, Aristotle, but yet there is among you, yea and of
your bringing up, that sought to destroy Alexander,&mdash;Calistenes,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
Aristotle, whose treasons against his prince shall not be borne out
with the reasons of his philosophie.</p>

<p><i>Aris.</i> If ever mischief entred into the heart of Calistenes, let      <span class="linenum">75</span>
Calistenes suffer for it; but that Aristotle ever imagined any such
thing of Calistenes, Aristotle doth denie.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Well, Aristotle, kindred may blinde thee, and affection me;
but in kings causes I will not stand to schollers arguments. This
meeting shal be for a commandement that you all frequent my               <span class="linenum">80</span>

let your lives bee answerable to your learnings, least my proceedings

<i>Alex.</i> I will. Plato, of all beasts which is the subtilest?</p>

<p><i>Plato.</i> That which man hitherto never knew.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Aristotle, how should a man be thought a god?</p>

<p><i>Aris.</i> In doing a thing unpossible for a man.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Crisippus, which was first, the day or the night?        <span class="linenum">90</span></p>

<p><i>Aris.</i> The day, by a day.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Indeede, strange questions must have strange answers.
Cleanthes, what say you, is life or death the stronger?</p>

<p><i>Cle.</i> Life, that suffereth so many troubles.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Crates, how long should a man live?                      <span class="linenum">95</span></p>

<p><i>Crates.</i> Till hee thinke it better to die than to live.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Anaxarchus, whether doth the sea or the earth bring forth
most creatures?</p>

<p><i>Anax.</i> The earth, for the sea is but a part of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Hephestion, me thinkes they have answered all well, and       <span class="linenum">100</span>
in such questions I meane often to trie them.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> It is better to have in your court a wise man than in your
ground a golden mine. Therefore would I leave war, to study
wisdom, were I Alexander.</p>

<p>
<i>Alex.</i> So would I, were I Hephestion.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> But come, let us goe

heart of the greatest conquerour of the world should be found in the
hands of the weakest creature of nature,&mdash;of a woman, of a captive?
Hermyns have faire skins, but foule livers; sepulchres fresh colours,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>but rotten bones; women faire faces, but false hearts. Remember,
Alexander, thou hast a campe to governe, not a chamber. Fall not <span class="linenum">60</span>
from the armour of Mars to the armes of Venus, from the fierie
assaults of warre to the maidenly skirmishes of love, from displaying
the eagle in thine ensigne to set downe the sparrow. I sigh,
Alexander, that, where fortune could not conquer, folly should
overcome. But behold all the perfection that may bee in Campaspe: <span class="linenum">65</span>
a haire curling by nature, not art; sweete alluring eyes; a faire face
made in despite of Venus; and a stately port in disdaine of Juno; a
wit apt to conceive and quicke to answere; a skinne as soft as silke
and as smooth as jet; a long white hand; a fine little foot,&mdash;to
conclude, all parts answerable to the best part. What of this? <span class="linenum">70</span>
Though she have heavenly gifts, vertue and beautie, is shee not of
earthly metall, flesh and bloud? You, Alexander, that would be a
god, shew your selfe in this worse than a man, so soone to be both
overseene and over-taken<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> in a woman, whose false teares know their
true times, whose smooth words wound deeper than sharpe swords. <span class="linenum">75</span>
There is no surfet so dangerous as that of honie, nor any poyson so
deadly as that of love: in the one physicke cannot prevaile, nor in
the other counsell.
</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> My case were light, Hephestion, and not worthy to be
called love, if reason were a remedie, or sentences could salve that <span class="linenum">80</span>
sense cannot conceive. Little do you know and therefore sleightly
doe you regard the dead embers in a private person or live coales in
a great prince, whose passions and thoughts doe as farre exceed
others in extremitie as their callings doe in majestie. An eclipse in
the sunne is more than the falling of a starre: none can conceive <span class="linenum">85</span>
the torments of a king, unlesse he be a king, whose desires are not
inferiour to their dignities. And then judge, Hephestion, if the
agonies of love be dangerous in a subject, whether they be not more
than deadly unto Alexander, whose deepe and not to bee conceived
sighes cleave the heart in shivers, whose wounded thoughts can <span class="linenum">90</span>
neither be expressed nor endured. Cease then, Hephestion, with
arguments to seeke to refell<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> that which with their deitie the gods
cannot resist; and let this suffice to answere thee,&mdash;that it is a king
that loveth, and Alexander, whose affections are not to bee measured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>by reason, being immortall, nor, I feare me, to be borne, being
<span class="linenum">95</span>
intolerable.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> I must needs yeeld, when neither reason nor counsell can
bee heard.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Yeeld, Hephestion, for Alexander doth love, and therefore
must obtaine.                                                        <span class="linenum">100</span>
</p>
<p><i>Hep.</i> Suppose shee loves not you? Affection commeth not by
appointment or birth; and then as good hated as enforced.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I am a king, and will command.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> You may, to yeeld to lust by force, but to consent to love
by feare, you cannot.
 <span class="linenum">105</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Why? What is that which Alexander may not conquer
as he list?</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> Why, that which you say the gods cannot resist,&mdash;love.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I am a conquerour, shee a captive; I as fortunate as shee      <span class="linenum">110</span>
faire: my greatnesse may answere her wants, and the gifts of my
minde the modestie of hers.  Is it not likely, then, that she should
love?  Is it not reasonable?</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> You say that in love there is no reason; and, therefore,
there can be no likelyhood.                                          <span class="linenum">115</span>

<p>
<i>Par.</i> In love, Clytus? No, no; it is as farre from his thought
as treason in ours. He, whose ever-waking eye, whose never-tired       <span class="linenum">15</span>

<p><i>Clytus.</i> Wee are readie at all commands, wishing nothing else

swelling in the pride of their owne power, the Scythians carelesse
what courage or fortune can do, the Egyptians dreaming in the          <span class="linenum">35</span>
southsayings of their augures and gaping over the smoake of their

<p><i>Alex.</i> I confesse the labour's fit for Alexander, and yet recreation      <span class="linenum">40</span>

doubt not but Alexander can, when hee will, throw affections as

<p><i>Camp.</i> Yes, my lord, seeing so disordered a countenance, hee

<span class="linenum">70</span></p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> Your Majestie must know, it is no lesse hard to paint
savours than vertues; colours can neither speake nor thinke.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Where doe you first begin when you draw any picture?</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> The proportion of the face in just compasse as I can.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I would begin with the eye, as a light to all the rest.
<span class="linenum">75</span></p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> If you will paint, as you are a king, Your Majestie may
beginne where you please; but as you would bee a painter, you
must begin with the face.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Aurelius<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> would in one houre colour foure faces.

<p><i>Apel.</i> No; but he doth it so homely.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> When will you finish Campaspe?</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> Never finish; for alwayes in absolute beauty there is
somewhat above art.
<span class="linenum">85</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Why should not I by labour be as cunning as Apelles?</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> God shield you should have cause to be so cunning<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> as

O Campaspe, Campaspe! Art must yeeld to nature, reason to

so farre inferiour to carving? Or dost thou, Venus, more delight

<i>Camp. sola.</i> Campaspe, it is hard to judge whether thy choyce
be more unwise or thy chance unfortunate. Doest thou preferre&mdash;but
stay, utter not that in wordes which maketh thine eares to
glow with thoughts. Tush, better thy tongue wagge than thy
heart breake! Hath a painter crept further into thy minde than a       <span class="linenum">5</span>

burne. Larkes, that mount aloft in the ayre, build their neasts       <span class="linenum">10</span>

place their hearts upon vassals. A needle will become thy fingers
better than a lute, and a distaffe is fitter for thy hand than a scepter.

<p><i>Camp.</i> If your tongue were made of the same flesh that your       <span class="linenum">25</span>

common thing it is amongst you to commend that oftentimes for
fashion sake you call them beautifull whom you know blacke.</p>

the blowing of winds, which whistle sometimes gently among the
leaves and straight waies turne the trees up by the rootes; or fire,
which warmeth afarre off, and burneth neere hand; or the sea,
which maketh men hoise their sailes in a flattering calme, and to      <span class="linenum">25</span>
cut their mastes in a rough storme. They place affection by times,
by policy, by appoyntment.  If they frowne, who dares call them
unconstant; if bewray secrets, who will tearme them untrue; if
fall to other loves, who trembles not, if hee call them unfaithfull?
In kings there can bee no love but to queenes; for as neere must      <span class="linenum">30</span>

<i>Apel.</i> I feare mee, Apelles, that thine eyes have blabbed that
which thy tongue durst not! What little regard hadst thou!
Whilest Alexander viewed the counterfeit of Campaspe, thou
stoodest gazing on her countenance. If he espie or but suspect,
thou must needs twice perish,&mdash;with his hate and thine owne love.      <span class="linenum">5</span>
Thy pale lookes when he blushed, thy sad countenance when he
smiled, thy sighes when he questioned, may breed in him a jelousie,
perchance a frenzie. O love! I never before knew what thou
wert, and now hast thou made me that I know not what my selfe
am! Onely this I know, that I must endure intolerable passions        <span class="linenum">10</span>
for unknowne pleasures. Dispute not the cause, wretch, but yeeld
to it; for better it is to melt with desire than wrastle with love.

<p><i>Lais.</i> You may talke of warre, speake bigge, conquer worlds

<p>
<i>Alex.</i> Methinketh, Hephestion, you are more melancholy than
you were accustomed; but I perceive it is all for Alexander. You
can neither brooke this peace nor my pleasure. Bee of good cheare;
though I winke, I sleepe not.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> Melancholy I am not, nor well content; for, I know not      <span class="linenum">5</span>
how, there is such a rust crept into my bones with this long ease
that I feare I shall not scowre it out with infinite labours.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Yes, yes, if all the travailes of conquering the world will
set either thy bodie or mine in tune, we will undertake them.  But
what thinke you of Apelles?  Did yee ever see any so perplexed?       <span class="linenum">10</span>
He neither answered directly to any question, nor looked stedfastly
upon any thing. I hold my life the painter is in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
<i>Hep.</i> It may be; for commonly we see it incident in artificers
to be enamoured of their owne workes, as Archidamus of his
wooden dove, Pygmalion of his ivorie image,<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> Arachne of her         15

conceits, now coveting<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> to draw a glancing eie, then a rolling, now
a winking, still mending it, never ending it, till they be caught with
it, and then, poore soules, they kisse the colours with their lips,
with which before they were loth to taint their fingers.              <span class="linenum">20</span>
</p>
<p><i>Alex.</i> I will find it out. Page, goe speedily for Apelles. Will
him to come hither; and when you see us earnestly in talke,
sodainly crie out, "Apelles shop is on fire!"</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> It shall be done.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Forget not your lesson.<span class="linenum"> 25</span>
</p>
 <p class="right">[<i>Exit Page.</i>]  </p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> I marvell what your devise shal be.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> The event shall prove.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> I pittie the poore painter if he be in love.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Pitie him not, I pray thee. That severe gravity set aside,
what doe you thinke of love?
 <span class="linenum">30</span></p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> As the Macedonians doe of their hearbe beet,&mdash;which
looking yellow in the ground and blacke in the hand,&mdash;thinke it
better seene than toucht.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> But what doe you imagine it to be?</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> A word, by superstition thought a god, by use turned to      <span class="linenum">35</span>
an humour, by selfe-will made a flattering madnesse.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> You are too hard-hearted to thinke so of love. Let us
goe to Diogenes. [<i>They cross the stage.</i>] Diogenes, thou mayst
thinke it somewhat that Alexander commeth to thee againe so soone.
</p>
<p><i>Diog.</i> If you come to learne, you could not come soone enough;      <span class="linenum">40</span>
if to laugh, you be come too soone.</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> It would better become thee to be more courteous and
frame thy self to please.</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> And you better to bee lesse, if you durst displease.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> What doest thou thinke of the time we have here?         <span class="linenum">45</span></p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> That we have little and lose much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
<i>Alex.</i> If one be sicke, what wouldst thou have him doe?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> Bee sure that hee make not his physician his heire.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> If thou mightest have thy will, how much ground would
content thee?                                                         <span class="linenum">50</span>
</p>
<p><i>Diog.</i> As much as you in the end must be contented withall.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> What, a world?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> No, the length of my bodie.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Hephestion, shall I bee a little pleasant with him?</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. You may; but hee will be very perverse with you.
  <span class="linenum">55</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. It skils not;<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> I cannot be angry with him. Diogenes,
I pray thee what doest thou thinke of love?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> A little worser than I can of hate.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> And why?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> Because it is better to hate the things which make to love      <span class="linenum">60</span>
than to love the things which give occasion of hate.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Why, bee not women the best creatures in the world?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> Next men and bees.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> What doest thou dislike chiefly in a woman?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> One thing.
    <span class="linenum">65</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> That she is a woman.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> In mine opinion thou wert never borne of a woman, that
thou thinkest so hardly of women. [<i>Enter Apelles.</i>]  But now
commeth Apelles, who I am sure is as farre from thy thoughts as        <span class="linenum">70</span>
thou art from his cunning.  Diogenes, I will have thy cabin<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> removed
neerer to my court, because I will be a philosopher.</p>

<p><i>Diog.</i> And when you have done so, I pray you remove your
court further from my cabin, because I will not be a courtier.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> But here commeth Apelles. Apelles, what peece of work      <span class="linenum">75</span>
have you now in hand?</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> None in hand, if it like your Majestie; but I am devising

<p><i>Alex.</i> Stay, Apelles; no haste. It is your heart is on fire, not
your shop; and if Campaspe hang there, I would shee were burnt.
But have you the picture of Campaspe? Belike you love her well,
that you care not though all be lost, so she be safe.</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> Not love her!  But your Majestie knowes that painters in      <span class="linenum">90</span>
their last workes are said to excell themselves; and in this I have
so much pleased my selfe, that the shadow as much delighteth mee,
being an artificer, as the substance doth others, that are amorous.</p>

made privie to your affection: though my counsell had not bin
necessary, yet my countenance might have beene thought requisite.
But Apelles, forsooth, loveth under hand; yea, and under Alexanders      <span class="linenum">100</span>
nose, and&mdash;but I say no more!</p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> Apelles loveth not so; but hee liveth to doe as Alexander
will.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Re-enter Page with Campaspe.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Campaspe, here is newes. Apelles is in love with you.</p>

<p><i>Camp.</i> It pleaseth your Majestie to say so.                     <span class="linenum">105</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Hephestion, I will trie her too.&mdash;Campaspe, for
the good qualities I know in Apelles and the vertue I see in you, I
am determined you shall enjoy one another. How say you, Campaspe,
would you say, "I?"</p>

<p><i>Camp.</i> Your hand-maid must obey if you command.
             <span class="linenum">110</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Thinke you not, Hephestion, that she would faine

<p><i>Camp.</i> But your Majestie may move a question where you be
   <span class="linenum">115</span>
willing to have a match.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> [<i>aside</i>]. Beleeve me, Hephestion, these parties are agreed;
they would have mee both priest and witnesse.&mdash;Apelles, take
Campaspe! Why move yee not? Campaspe, take Apelles! Will
it not be? If you be ashamed one of the other, by my consent you
<span class="linenum">120</span>
shall never come together. But dissemble not, Campaspe. Doe
you love Apelles?</p>

<p><i>Camp.</i> Pardon, my lord; I love Apelles.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Apelles, it were a shame for you, being loved so openly
of so faire a virgin, to say the contrairie. Do you love Campaspe?
 <span class="linenum">125</span></p>

<p><i>Apel.</i> Onely Campaspe!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Two loving wormes, Hephestion! I perceive Alexander
cannot subdue the affections of men, though he<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> conquer their
countries. Love falleth, like a dew, as well upon the low grasse as
upon the high cedar.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Sparkes have their heate, ants their gall,
<span class="linenum">130</span>
flies their spleene. Well, enjoy one another. I give her thee
frankly, Apelles. Thou shalt see that Alexander maketh but a toy
of love and leadeth affection in fetters, using fancie as a foole to
make him sport or a minstrell to make him merry. It is not the
amorous glance of an eye can settle an idle thought in the heart.      <span class="linenum">135</span>
No, no, it is childrens game, a life for seamsters and schollers;
the one, pricking in clouts,<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> have nothing else to think on; the
other, picking fancies out of books, have little else to marvaile
at. Go, Apelles, take with you your Campaspe; Alexander is
cloyed with looking on that which thou wondrest at.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
<span class="linenum">140</span></p>

Apelles.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Exeunt</i> [<i>Apelles and Campaspe</i>].</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Page, goe warne Clytus and Parmenio and the other lords
to be in a readinesse; let the trumpet sound; strike up the drumme;      <span class="linenum">145</span>
and I will presently into Persia. How now, Hephestion, is Alexander
able to resist love as he list?</p>

<p><i>Hep.</i> The conquering of Thebes was not so honourable as the
subduing of these thoughts.</p>
<p>
<i>Alex.</i> It were a shame Alexander should desire to command the      <span class="linenum">150</span>
world, if he could not command himselfe. But come, let us goe.

another to subdue, or, of<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> my word I will fall in love.

with himself that it neither sought for a Bed, nor was affraid to be alone in the dark, nor
desired any of our esteemed Dainties, he contrived a way to relieve his own Exigencies; being
the first, as some think, that folded in the Mantle, because his necessity obliged him to sleep
in it." <i>Lives of Philosophers</i>, VI., 402.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_788_788" id="Footnote_788_788"></a><a href="#FNanchor_788_788"><span class="label">[788]</span></a> The constant application of the epithet "Dog," to Diogenes is historically correct. When
Alexander first went to see the philosopher, he introduced himself thus: "I am Alexander,
surnamed the Great." To this Diogenes replied: "And I am Diogenes, surnamed the Dog."
The Athenians raised a pillar of Parian marble, surmounted with a dog, to his memory.</p></div>

<h3>CRITICAL ESSAY
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
 </h3>

<p><b>Life.</b>&mdash;George Peele, probably sprung from a Devonshire family, and
the son of James Peele, clerk of Christ's Hospital, is known to have been in
1565 a free scholar of the grammar school connected with that foundation.
He went to Oxford in 1571; studied at Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke
College, and at Christ Church; took his B.A. in 1577, his M.A. in
1579, and went up to London about 1580. At Oxford he already had the
name of poet, scholar, and dramatist. He was married, it would seem, as
early as 1583, to a wife who brought him some property; this, however,
soon vanished, and left the poet dependent upon his wits. Although the
stories in the <i>Jests</i> are musty old tales, fastened upon Peele, it is unlikely
that they settled on his name without a sense of fitness on the part of a public
that had known his ways,&mdash;his hopeless lack of pence, his good nature
and popularity, his shifts to beg, borrow, and cozen. With Greene, Nashe,
Marlowe, and a few lesser lights, he belonged to that group of scholars who
wrote plays, translations, occasional poems, pageants, and whatever else
would find a market. Now and then, it is almost certain, he appeared as
an actor. Of his dissolute course of life, its misery and squalour, there can
be no doubt whatever; "driven as myself," says Greene, "to extreme
shifts." As early as 1579 Peele had made trouble for his father; he lived
in poverty; and the curtain falls upon an ignoble end. Dying before 1598,
the poet barely saw his fortieth year.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Plays assigned to Peele.</b>&mdash;The best plays of Peele are <i>The Arraignment
of Paris</i>, published in 1584, and, in Fleay's opinion, played
as early as 1581,&mdash;a "first encrease," Nashe calls it, written in
smooth metres which doubtless had influence on Marlowe's own
verse; <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i>, published 1595; and the saccharine
<i>David and Bethsabe</i>, beloved of German critics. <i>Edward I.</i>, with
wofully corrupt text, is good only in parts; <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>,
published anonymously in 1594, is almost certainly Peele's, but
does not help his reputation; while <i>Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
quite certainly not Peele's in any way. Fleay, <i>Biographical Chronicle
of the English Drama</i>, II. 296, assigns it, along with <i>Common
Conditions</i> and <i>Appius and Virginia</i>, to R. B. (Richard Bower?),
whose initials appear on the title-page of the last-named play.
Professor Kittredge, however, <i>Journal of Germanic Philology</i>, II. 8,
suggests, as author of <i>Sir Clyomon</i>, Thomas Preston of <i>Cambyses</i>
fame. By way of compensation for this loss, Fleay (work quoted,
II. 155) attributes to Peele <i>The Wisdome of Doctor Doddipoll</i>, published
in 1600; there is dialect in the play, but overdone, good blank
verse, and an indifferent plot. The song, <i>What Thing is Love</i>,
hardly makes foundation enough for the assumption that Peele
wrote the play, even with the aid of an enchanter among the characters,
and a metre like that of <i>David and Bethsabe</i>. Further,
Fleay presents our author with <i>Wily Beguiled</i>, possibly, he thinks, a
university play; but his proof is not convincing. Kirkman, in a
catalogue of plays added to his edition of <i>Tom Tiler and his Wife</i>,
1661, credits George Peele not only with <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, but
with <i>Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany</i>, while Will Shakespeare has the
<i>Arraignment of Paris</i>. <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> is set down as anonymous.</p>

<p>In regard to Peele's miscellaneous and occasional poetry there
need be noted here only his clever use of blank verse in shorter
poems, his charming lyrics, and those noble lines at the end of the
<i>Polyhymnia</i>, beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"His golden locks time hath to silver turn'd."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b>Peele's Place in the Development of English Drama.</b>&mdash;Although we
had a text of absolute authority and a minutely accurate life of the
author, we should gain with all this lore no real stay for a study, a
critical understanding of <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i>, regarded as an element
in the making of English comedy. Peele and his play, along
with any hints of sources and models that are to be heeded, and
with whatever help may come from study of his other works, must
be fused into a single fact and compared with those "environmental
conditions" which influence all literary production. This will
determine the equation between art and nature, between the centrifugal
forces, which are always expressing themselves in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
what is called genius or originality, and the centripetal forces of a
great literary and popular development. It will determine the relation
of Peele's comedy to the line of English comedies.</p>

<p>Such a critical process leaves one with two qualities in mind that
seem to have had an initial force. They belong to Peele on contemporary
testimony confirmed by a study of his works. Tom
Nashe, more in eulogy than in discrimination, yet surely not without
a dash of critical discernment, calls Peele "the chief supporter of
pleasance now living, the atlas of poetry, and <i>primus verborum artifex</i>...."<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>Nashe undoubtedly flatters, but another of the "college," Greene,
in that death-bed appeal to his brother playwrights, was in no mood
for flattery; and it is probably sincere, even if mistaken, praise when
he calls Peele "in some things rarer, in nothing inferior," to Marlowe,
and to that "young juvenall" who may be Nashe or Lodge.
In what things Peele was "rarer," Greene fails to say, but a study
of <i>The Arraignment of Paris</i>, of <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, even of portions
of <i>Edward I.</i>, and of the <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>, supports the reputation of
Peele as an artist in words, and in prose as "well-languaged"; while
in <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> there greets the critic, not too openly, it is
true, but unmistakably, the quality of humour. Moreover, there
are the <i>Jests</i> which, apocryphal as they doubtless are, and sorry
stuff by any reckoning, nevertheless show that to people of his day
Peele was counted a merry fellow, a humourist in our sense of the
word.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> Perhaps Shakespeare's jests would seem as stale and flat if
we had the anecdotes that passed current among his successors at
the playhouse. In any case, George had a sense of humour which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>found utterance in this <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>; it is not the classical
humour of <i>Roister Doister</i>, not the hearty but clumsy mirth of <i>Gammer
Gurton</i>, but rather a hint of the extravagant and romantic which
turns upon itself with audible merriment at its own pretences, a
hint, not of farce or of wit merely, but of genuine humour, something
not to be found in Greene's lighter work,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> or in Lyly's
<i>Mother Bombie</i>, or in any of those earlier plays that did fealty to
the comic muse. Such, then, is the contemporary formula for
Peele as a power in the making of English drama: "<i>primus verborum
artifex</i>," and "chief supporter of pleasance." He was an artist in
words, and he had the gift of humour.</p>

<p>As regards this artistry in words, it is well known that the conditions
of English life, the vigour of speech as quickened by intercourse
in the street, the market-place, the exchange, where a spoken
word even in traffic and commerce still counted better than a
written word, dialogue and conversation better than oratory, and the
conditions of the stage itself, with its slender resources of scenery
and its confident appeal to the imagination, all helped to push this
pomp and mastery of phrase into the forefront of an Elizabethan
playwright's qualifications. Probably the spectator at a play felt
something of the interest which was then so rife in the world of
books and learning,&mdash;the interest in words as words, in the course
of a sentence as indicating more or less triumph over a still untrained
tongue. Nietzsche is extravagant but suggestive in certain
remarks that bear upon this verbal artistry in the drama. Speaking
of Nature and Art,<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> he insists that the Greeks taught men to like
pompous dramatic verse and an unnatural eloquence in those tragic
situations where mere nature is either stammering or silent. The
Italians went further and taught us to endure, in the opera, something
still more artificial and unnatural&mdash;a passion which not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
declaims, but sings. Tragic eloquence, sundered from nature, feeds
that pride which "loves art as the expression of a high heroic
unnaturalness and conventionality." "The Athenian," Nietzsche
goes on to say with cheerful heresy, "went into the theatre not to
be roused by pity and terror, but to listen to fine speeches." One
is inclined to think that this desire for fine speeches had a large
share in the motive which sent an Elizabethan to the play. Certainly
the drama responded to this demand more quickly than to
any demand for coherence of plot and delicacy of characterization.
Who led in this movement? Most critics brush aside all rivals
from the path of Marlowe and credit him alone with the "mighty
line," the pomp of diction, the sweep of word and figure, which
brought the drama from those puerilities of phrase and manner up
to its noble estate. This is true in the sense that Marlowe was
infinitely greater as a poet and a tragedian than either Greene or
Peele. But as <i>verborum artifex</i> it is probable that Marlowe has had
considerable credit which belongs to the others, particularly Peele;
and the testimony of Nashe and Greene, who knew the craft, must
not be rejected so utterly. Campbell, it is true, praised Peele as
"the oldest genuine dramatic poet of our language"; but Symonds,
and with him are such scholars as Mr. A. W. Ward, asserts that
Peele "discovered no new vein." Symonds is inclined to look on
Greene as herald<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> and Marlowe as founder; Peele is a pleasant but
unimportant maker of plays and verse. Greene, he thinks, began
the school of gentleman and scholars who wrote for the stage at a
time when rhyming plays were in vogue; but none of those which
Greene wrote has come down to our day. Marlowe now comes
imperiously upon the scene, forces his blank verse into favour, and is
at last reluctantly admitted by Greene and the others into their
"college." So runs the theory of Symonds. Quite opposed to
this view of the case is Mr. Fleay, who declares that Marlowe
followed George Peele in the article of "flowing blank verse."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>
There can be no question, moreover, that certain critics have
exalted Greene too high and put Peele too low. Peele had quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
as much as Greene to do with the refining and energizing of English
dramatic diction, a process aptly described by Thomas Heywood
in his <i>Apology for Actors</i>:<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> "Our English tongue ... is now
<i>by this secondary meanes of playing</i> continually refined, every writer
striving in himselfe to adde a new florish unto it." Plots remained
clumsy, crude; but what change in the diction of plays! In <i>Appius
and Virginia</i> there is still puerile diction and jog-trot metre,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"They framèd also after this, out of his tender side,</div>
<div class="i0">A piece of much formosity, with him for to abide."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">From this to blank verse and compressed or energetic diction, as
(<i>Jeronimo</i>),&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"My knee sings thanks unto your Highness bounty,"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">is a progress involving vast reformings, and some deformings,<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
in diction and in metre, of such sweep that Elizabethans put these
qualities first when they went about to judge a play. "Your nine
comœdies," writes Harvey to Spenser, come nearer to Ariosto's,
"eyther for the finenesse of plausible Elocution, or the rareness of
Poetical Invention," than the <i>Faery Queene</i> to the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.
In this ennobling of diction, Peele may not have led the column of
playwrights, but he was certainly in the van. His achievement
must not be dashed by a comparison with Shakespeare, who covered
up absurdities of plot&mdash;as in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>&mdash;by
brilliant characterization, where this earlier group depended upon
the art of words.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> For the related art of brave metres, of a "flowing
blank verse" in plays, we have no space to argue upon the
claims of leadership. Enough is done for the matter if one remembers
that Peele, who wrote admirable blank verse before Marlowe
was out of his teens, had nothing to learn from the greater poet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>about the management of this metre in and for itself.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Certainly
he got more music out of the pentameter than any earlier dramatist
had done; witness such a movement as,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"What sign is rainy and what star is fair,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">or,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"And water running from the silver spring."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b>The Old Wives' Tale, an Innovation in Comedy.</b>&mdash;It may be conceded
that Peele "discovered no new vein" in diction and in metre,
although his work in each was of a high order, not far removed
from leadership. Different is the case when one considers his
claims for innovation in comedy. He was the first to blend
romantic drama with a realism which turns romance back upon
itself, and produces the comedy of subconscious humour. The
tragedies, and even the miracle plays, while extravagant in form,
had not been altogether unnatural in action. The supernatural in
that age was not unnatural. The unnatural was mainly confined
to the diction. Gradually, as every one knows, the romantic element,
in a wide sense, got upper hand and ruled the English drama.
In <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> this romantic spirit comes in, not as a new
element, but as a new kind of "art" grafted upon the "nature"
of the rough and comic stock; and to the reader's surprise draws
away all unnaturalness from the dialogue, which is now plain,
natural, commonplace.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> Realism in diction was no new thing;
romance in plot was not an innovation; it was the clash, the interplay,
the subjective element, the appeal to something more than
a literal understanding of what is said and done, a new appeal to
a deeper sense of humour&mdash;here lay the new vein discovered by
George Peele. The romantic drama, we repeat, was known; witness
that little group of "folk-lore romances," as Mr. Fleay calls
them, <i>Common Conditions</i>, <i>Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes</i>, and <i>Appius
and Virginia</i>; the two former are full of adventures, of amorous
knights and wandering ladies, a Forest of Strange Marvels, an Isle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
of Strange Marshes, what not. In all of them, however, the
romance is presented in unnatural diction, to suit such unnatural
doings, and justifies those bitter words of the <i>Second and Third Blast
of Retrait from Plaies and Theaters</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> that "the notablest lier is
become the best Poet ... for the strangest Comedie brings greatest
delectation ... faining countries neuer heard of, monsters and prodigious
creatures that are not...." A milder romantic drama, but
without the humour which we mean, is Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.
The other plays, however, have no humour at all except the traditional
humour of the Vice; and of the three representatives, Conditions,
who finally turns pirate, is certainly a far merrier person than
Haphazard in <i>Appius</i> or Subtle Shift in <i>Sir Clyomon</i>. There is
realistic setting in <i>Common Conditions</i>, with some lively dialogue,
and a distinctly catching song and chorus<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> of tinkers, at the opening
of the play. It is "business" here, however, not that dramatic
irony, springing from contrast of romantic plot and realistic diction,
which makes a sufficiently timid beginning in <i>The Old Wives'
Tale</i>, and grows so insistent in <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>.
Moreover, Peele's realistic work shows the control and consciousness
of a higher art. There are no peasants like Hodge in <i>Gammer
Gurton</i>, Corin in <i>Sir Clyomon</i>, and Hob and Lob in <i>Cambyses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
There is an outburst or two of yokel wit in Peele's play; but there
is no breaking of heads, no chance for the clown to sing a song
while drunk, as Hance does in the interlude of <i>Like Wil to Like</i>.
These signs of a subtler conception of his art should be placed
to Peele's credit; for while an obvious dialect marks Hodge and
Corin and the rest, Clunch and Madge speak a plain English, reminding
one irresistibly of the milk-woman's talk with Piscator:
it smacks of cottage and field and hedge-rows and, as Nashe would
say, has "old King Harrie sinceritie." There is a difference as
between the exaggerated "hayseed" of a comic paper and the finer
drawing in one of Hardy's peasants. Exaggeration would spoil the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
sense of contrast between honest Madge and the high pretences of
the plot. In Huanebango there is girding not only at Harvey, but
at the romance hero in general; this big-mouthed, impossible fellow,
with Corebus as a foil, foreshadows, however dimly, the far more
clever presentation of an English Don Quixote in the person of Ralph.</p>

<p>A second element of humour in this realistic treatment of
romance is the use of an induction, or rather of a combination
of the induction and the play within the play, as a means of expressing
dramatic irony. Although the induction springs from the
prologue, and although the opening of <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> is technically
an induction, like many another of the time, it has to our
thinking a distinctly new vein. What Schwab<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> calls the first
example of the use of an induction&mdash;in <i>The Rare Triumphs of Love
and Fortune</i>&mdash;makes both induction and play connected parts of a
whole. It is a dramatic device, wholly objective in character,
external, with no demand upon the sense of contrast. Different,
but hardly a new idea,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> is the induction as employed by Greene in
<i>Alphonsus</i> and <i>James IV.</i>; here is a return to the old notion of the
prologue, a justifying of the playwright's way. Will Summer,
the pet jester,<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> who ushers in Nashe's play, calls himself outright
a kind of chorus. In the old <i>Taming of a Shrew</i>, printed in 1594,
Sly, while only a casual commentator upon the play, is entirely
outside of the main action, which, as Schwab points out, thus becomes
an actual play within the play. Still, even in these cases,
the contrast is objective and direct. The induction is a clever
device to heighten interest in the play. Before, it had served the
playwright as an expression of his purpose in the main drama;
later, as with Ben Jonson, it voiced his critical opinions. Whether
objective or subjective, however, the contrast between play and
induction is direct. Quite different is that induction, which Schwab
rightly calls remarkable, in <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>; and
different, too, is that earlier attempt, which Schwab unaccountably
fails to mention, in <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i>. These both appeal to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
sense of humour awakened by the interplay of theme and treatment,
of character and situation. In Peele's play this involution of epic,
drama, and comment&mdash;a seeming confusion which has distressed
many of the critics&mdash;really heightens the dramatic power of the
piece. The induction is double. First come a bit of romance,
with the lost wanderers in the wood, and a realistic foil in their own
dialogue&mdash;by no means the "heavy prose" of Collier's censure.
Secondly comes outright realism with Clunch, Madge, the bread and
cheese, and the old joke about bedfellows, cleverly followed by
Madge's abrupt raid upon romantic ground. She is well started,
but stumbling, when the other actors break in; and the inner play,
not without some confusion and mystification, runs its course.
Perhaps the sense of huddling, abruptness, confusion, is intentional
as part of an old wives' tale indeed; perhaps, again, this
must be laid to the charge of Peele's carelessness in "plotting
plaies." Be that as it may be, the interplay of these elements
makes a new kind of comedy; and the humour of this play, crude
and tentative as it seems when compared with the humour of Uncle
Toby<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> and of those lesser lights that revolve in the orbit of the
Quixotic contrast, differs from earlier essays of the sort in that it
is not a separate element of fun, but rather something which exists
in solution with the comedy itself. <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> lies
midway between the utter lack of coherence in Nashe's play and
the subtlety of Beaumont and Fletcher. Will Summer is often
irrelevant and tiresome; the main action, on which he comments,
is now pathetic, now farcical, now merely spectacular; but in our
play the thread of romance runs throughout unbroken and keeps
the piece in a sort of unity, while the comment, whether direct or
hinted, has a vastly finer vein of irony. The romantic side of
folk-lore has its due withal, as in the test of fidelity at the end
between Eumenides and Jack, with the proposed division of Delia&mdash;a
<i>casus</i> always acceptable to such an audience, and here of acute
though subordinate interest. Moreover, Peele has a kind of reticence
and control in his art; he suggests in a whisper what Will
Summer would have roared into commonplace and horse-play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
<b>The Background of Folk-Lore.</b>&mdash;Finally, the very <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>
itself, with its background of folk-lore, that tryst of ancient splendour
with modern poverty and ignorance on the territory of a forgotten
faith, is a thing of quietly humorous contrasts. Several
elements are to be considered in the charming little medley which
Peele has made from the folk-lore of his day&mdash;"that curious
<i>mélange</i> of nursery tales," as Mr. Joseph Jacobs calls it. The
enchanter and his spells, the stolen daughter and her brothers' quest,
make a familiar central group. Perhaps Madge set out to tell the
story of <i>Childe Rowland</i>, familiar to Elizabethans,<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> although <i>Jack the
Giant Killer</i> has his claims. The <i>fee-fa-fum</i>, as every one knows,
occurs also in Shakespeare's <i>Lear</i>. The help of the White Bear&mdash;a
transformation, like the saws and prophecies, sufficiently familiar
in these tales&mdash;is similar to that of Merlin in <i>Childe Rowland</i>; but
the ghost of Jack reminds one of the other story. Mr. Jacobs
quotes Kennedy that in a parallel Irish tale "Jack the servant is
the spirit of the buried man." One has only to make this substitution,
and the vicarious gratitude of the Giant Killer<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> is better
explained. Perhaps, too, Peele has borrowed some of his thunder
and lightning, as well as Huanebango's <i>fee-fa-fum</i>, from the
giants; and the disenchantment at the hands of an invisible hero
may belong, in part, to this tale. Two other folk-tales may be
named&mdash;<i>The Well of the World's End</i>, mentioned, if a slight
emendation be allowed, in <i>The Complaynt of Scotland</i>, and <i>The Three
Heads of the Well</i>&mdash;as known, in some form, to Peele, and used
directly in the story of the two daughters. The familiar theme of
the so-called "death index"<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> is touched but slightly; and perhaps
it is unnecessary to go to the <i>Red Ettin</i> for a parallel to Huanebango
and Corebus, who respectively refuse and give a piece of
cake to the helpful old man. The theme is common in folk-lore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
It is interesting to note that Beaumont and Fletcher show a liking
for folk-tales, as well as for traditional songs and ballads, in that
play, which by its induction and general spirit most closely resembles
this <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>. More dignified sources were long ago pointed
out by Warton, who remarked that "the names of some of the
characters ... are taken from the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>." Meroe, in
Apuleius, was invoked. But it seems clear enough that English
folk-lore must be the mainstay of critics who think all is done for
a work of literature when they have found out every possible and
impossible source for plot, sideplot, and allusion.</p>

<p><b>Literary Estimate.</b>&mdash;The marvel, after all, is not that these materials
are huddled and confused in the combination; the confusion
is part of the artistic process, and if the figures move across the
stage without firm connection one with the other, that, too, is done
after the manner of the old tale. We are on romantic ground,
and are to see by glimpses. Here is no comedy of incident, in the
usual meaning of the term, no comedy of intrigue or of manners.
It is rather a comedy of comedies, a saucy challenge of romance,
where art turns, however timidly, upon itself. Perhaps Peele wrote
this play, as Dryden wrote <i>All for Love</i>, to please himself. Unquestionably,
until Mr. Bullen made a plea for mercy, <i>The Old
Wives' Tale</i> had been shamefully treated. Collier<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> calls it "nothing
but a beldam's story, with little to recommend it but heavy
prose and not much lighter blank verse," a most inadequate summary
from any point of view. The play, he thinks, has "a disgusting
quantity of trash and absurdity." Dyce, while regarding
Peele's "superiority to Greene" as "unquestionable," is not enthusiastic
about <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i>. Mr. Ward speaks<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> of "the
labyrinthine intricacy of the main scenes," knows not whether to
call it farce or interlude, and would pass it by save for the suggestion
of <i>Comus</i>. But Mr. Bullen very properly objects to this unfair comparison.
Symonds, to be sure, uses it even more unfairly. <i>The
Old Wives' Tale</i>, he makes bold to say, is the sow's ear to Milton's
silk purse.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> With an unusual blindness to literary perspective,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Symonds goes on to judge this flickering little candle of romance,
folk-lore, and half-roguish, half-ironical suggestion, by the sun-blaze
of Milton's high seriousness and full poetic splendours. Peele,
it seems, does not "lift his subject into the heavens of poetry....
The wizard is a common conjurer. The spirit is a vulgar village
ghost." Why not, pray? What should they be for the purposes
of this old wives' tale? What would be left, say, of Chaucer's
charming little story, that "folye, as of a fox, or of a cok and hen,"
if one were to pulverize it with such critical tools? Peele is not
trying to raise comedy into the heavens; he left that for his betters;
and the ineffectual Delia is a long remove from Hermia and Helena
in the "wood near Athens." What Peele, George Peele of the
dingy jests, probably tried to do, and what he surely succeeded in
doing, was to bring a new and more subtle strain of humour into
the drama. <i>Itur in antiquam silvam.</i> Realism left shabby and squalid
things, alehouse wit, and laid hold of a sweeter life. Reckless,
good-natured scholar, George fairly followed the call which haunted
so many academic outcasts, the call which Marlowe and Greene
and Dekker answered with those sweet songs of country life, and
which led Peele to the making of this play. He wove romance
and realism into a fabric that may well show a coarse pattern and
often very clumsy workmanship, but, on the whole, it is a pleasing
pattern and a new. Moreover, it is all made of sound English
stuff. The tales he used for his main drama were familiar to English
ears; the persons of his framework play were kindly folk of
any English village, and the air of it all is as fresh and wholesome
as an English summer morning.</p>

<p><b>Sources, Title, Text.</b>&mdash;The sources of the play, so far as one
may speak of sources, are indicated in general above, and in particular
by notes to the following text. The plural form of the title
ought probably to be singular, in spite of common usage, the gloss
<i>ealdra cwéna spel</i> (Wright, <i>Voc.</i>), and 1 Timothy iv, 7; Mr. Fleay,
perhaps as a concession to Madge, prints <i>Old Wifes' Tale</i> (<i>Biog.
Chron. Eng. Drama</i>, II. 154).<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> He puts the date of composition
"clearly 1590," on the theory that Harvey&mdash;Huanebango&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
here satirized by Peele as a consequence of Harvey's attack upon
Lyly in 1589,&mdash;circulated then in manuscript though not printed
until 1593. Lämmerhirt<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> argues, but not conclusively, that the
play was written before 1588,&mdash;partly because of the allusions to
Harvey, and partly because style and form point to an early period
in the author's development. Until a surer date can be established,
however, 1590 will serve as the time of composition for this play.
<i>The Old Wives' Tale</i>, says Dyce, "had sunk into complete oblivion,
till Steevens ... communicated to Reed the account of it which
appeared in the <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>." In 1783 Steevens writes
to Warton: "All I have learned in relation to the original from
which the idea of Milton's <i>Comus</i> might be borrowed, I communicated
to Mr. Reed.... Only a single copy of his [<i>sic</i>] <i>Old
Wives' Tale</i> has hitherto appeared, and even that is at present out of
my reach...."<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> As to the rhythmic structure, E. Penner notes<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>
that of 964 lines of this play 192 are five-stress or ordinary heroic
verse, 7 are hexameters, and 100 short verses. The rest is prose.</p>

<p>The best edition is, of course, that of Bullen, in 3 vols., 1888-[B];
but there were excellent editions by Dyce, one in 1828 ff., and
another in 1861-[Dy.]. The present text of <i>The Old Wives'
Tale</i> is from the 1595 quarto in the British Museum; the title-page
is, with the exception of the vignettes, a fair representation of
the original.</p>

customers; and England had been a land of song from Cædmon's time down. The "man
in the street" was expected to know how to join in a part song. The rural song, such as
they sing here, was a great favorite with the dramatists.</p></div>

APPENDIX</h2>

<p><b><a id="A_Characters"></a>A. Characters: their Sources.</b>&mdash;T. Warton, in 1785 (<i>Milton's Poems
on Several Occasions</i>), pointed out that "the names of some of the characters
as Sacrapant, Chorebus, and others, are taken from the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>."
Peele quotes Ariosto freely near the end of <i>Edward I</i>. Storojenko (Grosart's
<i>Greene</i>, I, 180) thinks the Sacrapant in Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i> "a very
transparent parody of <i>Tamburlaine</i>." Mr. Fleay, with some daring, asserts
that Huanebango is travestied from Huon o'Bordeaux, and is "palpably
Harvey." Erestus, says the same authority, is from Kyd's <i>Soliman and
Perseda</i>; "the play is evidently full of personal allusions, which time only
can elucidate." Mr. Ward remarks that Jack is "namesake and rival of
the immortal giant-killer." The classics, of course, are represented. Warton
remarked that the story of Meroe could be found in Adlington's translation
of Apuleius, 1566; but it is hardly necessary to go to such a source
for the "White Bear of England's Wood."</p>

<p><b>B. The Song of the Harvesters</b>&mdash;When the harvest-men enter again,
and sing the song "doubled,"&mdash;as here,&mdash;it is evidently the same thing,
a companion piece, only with reaping in place of sowing, and words to
match:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Lo, here we come a-reaping, a-reaping,</div>
<div class="i2">To reap our harvest-fruit.</div>
<div class="i0">And thus we pass the year so long,</div>
<div class="i2">And never be we mute."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">Is it too much, then, to assume that the present song is to be restored somewhat
as follows?&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Lo here we come a-sowing, a-sowing,</div>
<div class="i2">And sow sweet fruits of love.</div>
<div class="i0">All that lovers be pray you for me,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">In your sweethearts well may it prove.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">They would naturally enter with motions of sowing or of reaping, and the
opening words would fit the action. Moreover, "In your sweethearts well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
may it prove" must refer to requital not for the act of sowing, but for the
prayers invoked. These craft-songs were common enough. In <i>Summer's
Last Will and Testament</i> the harvest-men sing an old folk-song of this kind,
if one may judge by the <i>Hooky, hooky</i> of the refrain, said by one of the Dodsley
editors (ed. 1825, IX, 41) to be heard still "in some parts of the kingdom."
The curious in these matters may find valuable information about
songs of labour in general, with imitative action and suitable refrains, in

GREENE'S PLACE IN COMEDY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the group of gifted college-bred men who had some part in the
fashioning of Shakespearian drama and drew into their mortal lungs
a breath of the element whose "air was fame," Greene has long
been marked with unenviable distinction. He had the misfortune
to try to darken with an early and single shaft the rising sun of
Shakespeare; and he has stood out like a shadow against that dawning
genius ever since. The mean circumstances of his Bohemian
career, and the terribly brutal, Zolaesque scene of his death-chamber&mdash;the
most repulsively gruesome in English literary annals&mdash;have
sustained with a lurid light the unfavourable impression; and,
were this really all, no one would have grudged oblivion the man's
memory. The edition of his collected works, however, which
Grosart gave to scholars, has enlarged general knowledge of Greene,
and has permitted the formation of a more various image of his
personality, a juster estimate of his literary temperament, and a
clearer judgment concerning his position in the Elizabethan movement
of dramatic imagination; and some few, even before this, had
lifted up protestation against that ready damnation which seemed
provided for him by his irreverence toward the undiscovered god
of our idolatry who, then fleeting his golden days, seemed to this
jaundiced eye "an upstart crow beautified with our feathers, ...
the only Shake-scene in a country." Never were more unfortunate
words for the "blind mouth" that uttered them. But there is
more to know of Greene than this one speech; and though the
occasion is not apt here for so complete a valuation of his character
and temperament, his deeds and works, as is to be desired for
truth's sake, yet it is needful to take some notice of his total
personality as evinced in his novels, plays, poems, and pamphlets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
in order to determine his relative station in the somewhat limited
sphere of English comedy.</p>

<p>Marlowe is commonly regarded as the forerunner of the heroic
strain in Shakespeare, with moulding influence on the imaginative
habit of his younger fellow-workman in respect to that phase of
his art; and Greene, who though he will never shine as a "morning-star"
of the drama was at least a twin luminary with Marlowe,
has been credited with occupying a similar position as the forerunner
of Shakespeare with respect to the portrayal of vulgar life.
It is hardly to be expected that an antithesis so convenient for
the critics should be really matter-of-fact. The narrower distinct
claim that the Clown in his successive reincarnations passed
through the world of Greene's stage on his way from his old fleshly
prison in the Vice of the primitive English play may require less
argument; and in several other particulars it may appear that fore-gleams
of the Shakespearian drama are discernible in Greene's
works without drawing the consequence that Shakespeare was necessarily
a pupil in every school that was open to him. Not to treat
the matter too precisely, where precision is apt to be illusory even
if attainable in appearance, was there not a plain growth of Greene
as a man of letters closely attached to his time which will illustrate
the general development of the age and its art, and naturally bring
out those analogies between his work and Shakespeare's that have
been thought of as formative elements in him by which his successor
on the stage profited? The line of descent does not matter,
on the personal side, if the general direction of progress be made
out.</p>

<p>Greene was distinctively a man of letters. He was born with
the native gift, and he put it to use in many ways. He tried all
kinds of writing, from prose to verse, from song to sermon, and
apparently with equal interest. He was college-bred and must have
been of a scholarly and receptive temperament; he was variously
read in different languages and subjects; and he began by being what
he charged Shakespeare with being,&mdash;an adapter. His tales, like
others of the time, must be regarded as in large measure appropriations
from the fields of foreign fiction. Even as he went on and
gained a freer hand for expression, he remained imitative of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
with occasional flashes of his own talent; and, dying young, he
cannot be thought to have given his genius its real trial of thorough
originality. In the main his work is derivative and secondary and
represents or reflects literary tradition and example; he was still in
the process of disencumbering himself of this external reliance when
he was exhausted, and perished; and it is in those later parts of his
work which show originality that he is attached to the Shakespearian
drama. Slight examination will justify this general statement
in detail. It is agreed that he drew his earlier novels from
the stock-fiction, with its peculiar type of woman and its moral
lesson; and he shows in these sensibility of imagination and grace
of style. He was, more than has been thought, a stylist, a born
writer; and this of itself would interest him in the euphuistic
fashion, then coming to its height in Lyly; and besides he always
kept his finger on the pulse of the time and was ambitious to succeed
by pleasing the popular taste: he adopted euphuism temporarily,
employing it in his own way. In the drama his play,
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>, harks back to Ariosto, and it was when the stage
rang with <i>Tamburlaine</i> that he brought out <i>Alphonsus, King of
Aragon</i>, and when <i>Doctor Faustus</i> was on the boards that he followed
with <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>; on Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>
succeeded his own <i>Menaphon</i>; and if <i>James IV.</i> with its Oberon
preceded <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>&mdash;which is undetermined&mdash;it
was a unique inversion of the order which made Greene always
the second and not the first. In view of this literary chronology
it seems clear that in the start and well on into his career Greene
was the sensitive and ambitious writer following where Italian
tradition, contemporary genius, and popular acclaim blazed the
way; and in so doing his individual excellence lay not in originality
on the great scale, but in treatment, in his modification of the
<i>genre</i>, in his individual style and manner and purport&mdash;in the
virtues, that is to say, of an able, clever, variously equipped man
of letters whose talent had not yet discovered the core of genius in
itself.</p>

<p>It is observable, too, in the earlier period of his work, that in his
treatment of his material so derived, he displays the qualities of the
weaker, the less robust literary habit; he uses refinement, he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
checked by his good taste, he strives for effects less violent, less sensational,
less difficult in the sense that it requires less of the giant's
strength to carry them off well. There is little, too, in this portion
of his work which lets personality burn through the literary mould;
that belongs to his late and stronger time. It is true that his novels
have a moral in them for edification; but, although he had the
preacher's voice, it is not here in the earlier tales that it is heard;
it was the immemorial privilege of the Renaissance tale, however
scandalous, to wear cowl and cassock. In the cardinal point of his
delineation of female character, for which he is highly praised because
of the purity and grace of the womanhood he presented, he follows
the Renaissance convention, as it seems to me, but with refining
and often true English touches&mdash;that ideal of Italian origin which
is, on the whole, one of outline, of pale graciousness, of immobile
or expressive beauty, pictorial; these women seem like lovely portraits
which have stepped down out of a frame, and have only so
much of life as an environment of light and air and silence can give
them. Are they not, for example, as truly like Spenser's women&mdash;except
where Spenser's are differentiated by doing "manly" parts&mdash;as
they are prophetic of Shakespeare's simpler types? Greene,
no doubt, incorporated in this ideal something of his own experience
of noble and patient womanhood, possibly as he had known
it in his wife, as Shakespeare embodied eternal reality in his creations;
but it would not occur to me to believe that Shakespeare found a
model for Ophelia or Imogen in the Lady Ida and Dorothea, any
more than in Una and her sisters. All these before Shakespeare are
of one family&mdash;they are the conventionalized Renaissance ideal
variously modified and filled with richer artistic life; but in Shakespeare
they pass into that clear luminous air where art and humanity
are one thing. Greene should have our admiration for his sensibility
to the type, for the appreciation with which he drew it, for the charm
he thereby clothed his pages with; but as to there being a line of
descent, that is altogether another thing; and in respect to Greene
himself, his special female characterization imports the element of
refinement in him, the trait of the less robust literary habit just
spoken of. Similarly, he was of too sound taste to be long content
to speak in the cut phrase of euphuism, and he soon laid the fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
off; and, in his afterplay on the <i>Tamburlaine</i> motive, it is a matter
of debate whether he was parodying or rivalling Marlowe's large-languaged
rhetoric, and, whichever he was doing, he was hampered
by a better taste than his model, either laughing at it, or else without
the giant's strength to succeed in the worser way, and to
<i>Doctor Faustus</i> and <i>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>, so far as they
are compared, like remarks apply. Greene has his own virtues
in all these instances, but they are not those of originating
power, of creative overflow, of genius of the Elizabethan stripe;
they live within the narrower circle of improvement through refined
taste, or else of satirical protest or comparative failure due to the
same trait.</p>

<p>The thought of refinement in connection with Greene, the stress
laid upon it here, has not been commonly prominent in writings
upon him, and is out of harmony with our traditional impression of
him&mdash;the envious and dying profligate in his misery. Yet it is to
be found not only in his early portraits of womanhood of the pure
type (he afterward presented a baser one), nor in the fact often
noted of the marked purity of his works; but more pervasively in
his continuing taste, in those habits and choices in the literary field,
those revolts and reforms, which show the steady rightness of the
man in his self-criticism and his criticism of current successes. I
seem to feel this innate refinement in the limpidity of single lines;
but it is plain to every one in the lovely lyrics which have sung
themselves into the hearts of all lovers of our poetry, those songs,
found in all anthologies of English verse, which bear Greene's
name. He was a gross man, living grossly, as all know; but it
sometimes happens that in such fleshly natures&mdash;as, every one will
at once think, in Ben Jonson&mdash;there is found this flower of delicacy,
the very fragrance of the soul; and so it was with Greene,
and the lyrics are the mortal sign of this inward grace. It belongs
with this, as has been observed by several writers, that of all the
men who preceded Shakespeare, Greene most lets the breath of the
English country blow through his pages, and likes to lay his scene in
some rural spot. He loved the country; and yet, here too, protest
may well be made when it is said that in this he led the way for
Shakespeare; surely all country paths were open to the Warwickshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
lad in his own right; nor need the difference be allowed that the
forest of Arden is a conventionalized nature, as one critic maintains,
while Greene's is of the soil&mdash;that is to mistake art for convention;
but to say even this one word in passing in behalf of
Shakespeare's nature-reality is superfluous, except that it suggests the
different road by which Shakespeare here, as well as in his dealing
with madness, witchcraft, and fairyland (in all of which Greene is
said to have taught him), went his own ways, irrespective of comrades
of the time. In this love of the country which Greene had
lies the key to the better man in him and to his own native distinctions.
Beneath his literary temperament, which seems an educational
and professional veneer that should finally drop away, is
his genuine nature&mdash;the man he was; and, life going on to imminent
wreck, it became clear in his later works that he was more
and more engaged in contemporary life, in what he saw and knew,
and that he took his material from these; he had written autobiographical
sketches and accounts of low life and its characters, and
he had displayed certain tendencies toward preaching and sympathies
with the unredeemed masses of humanity, all somewhat miscellaneously,
and without any other art than a strong prose style;
but, at the end, is it not manifest that he had grown into realism as
his material, and into an attitude of moral denunciation and popular
sympathy in dealing with it, and is not this the significance of his
collaboration with Lodge in <i>A Looking-Glasse for London and England</i>,
and of his own unique <i>George-a-Greene</i>? All the earlier work seems
to end, and new beginnings appear both in his renderings of contemporary
realism, and in his most imaginative and various play,
<i>James IV.</i></p>

<p>The gradual substitution, then, as Greene came to his time of
strength, of frank English realism for cultured Italian tradition and
contemporary vital literary example, seems to be the true line of his
growth. It shows distinctly in his choice of the English subject of
Roger Bacon in place of Doctor Faustus, in his satire of certain
aspects of court life, when he translated an Italian plot of Cinthio
into apocryphal history as <i>James IV.</i>, in his presentation of the state
of London in collaboration with Lodge, and in the half-rebellious
play of <i>George-a-Greene</i>. This is the imaginative and artistic side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
of what is practical in his pamphlets of personal repentance and
cony-catching. Personally I seem to detect Puritanism morally in
the one half, and Puritanism politically in the other half, of this late
dramatic work; but it cannot be maintained that the case is certain.
Apart from that, Greene was&mdash;what so few ever are, even
in an Elizabethan environment&mdash;a humourist; and he used the old
English comedy tradition as an element in his purely English work.
The matter is so plain and comparatively so slight as to require
the fewest words. In comedy specifically he gave examples, which
he may be said to have first given in the sense that he gave them in
an original or a developed form, of the court fool in Ralph, of the
country bumpkin or crass fool in Miles, of the highly developed and
wholly humanized <i>Vice</i> in Adam, of a special humouristic type
(aptly characterized as the ancestor of Andrew Fairservice) in
Andrew, otherwise not born till Sir Walter Scott's day, and of the
true Shakespearian clown, the unmistakable one, in Slipper. Such
was his definite service to comedy in respect to type; and criticism
can only point it out, because the substance can be given only by
reading the characters attentively. In regard to humour at large, it
appears to me that in his hands, apart from linguistic felicity and
wit, he presents a humour of situation tending toward pure farce, and
a humour of intention tending toward pure satire of the social variety,
and a humour of manners tending toward pure pleasantry as in the
"Vail Staff" episode. The single link binding him with Shakespeare,
in comedy is through the character of Slipper; and yet here, as in
the other instances of female type, love of country scenes, and also
in madness, witchcraft, and fairyland, I cannot believe that Shakespeare
may not have arrived at his end&mdash;in this case, Launce&mdash;without
necessarily being obliged to Greene for assistance. The
bent toward contemporary realism, toward a well-languaged and
winning clown, toward Englishry, which is another name for nature
in human life and its setting, is plain in Greene; this was the
running of the stream; but no larger inference follows from it in my
mind than that Greene had worked out his growth, as Shakespeare
in his apprenticeship also did, in similar directions, but that Greene
had done it on national lines, whereas Shakespeare did it on universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
lines, that Greene had done it in a practical, whereas Shakespeare
did it in an ideal way, and that Greene had done it largely
under personal conditions, being at war with his fate as a mere
man, whereas Shakespeare did it as a human spirit above the reach of
material vicissitude. What one owed to the other is an insignificant
detail at best; what is important is to observe in Greene the
advancing movement of the drama in moral intention, in higher
characterization, in original phases of humanity, in humour of more
body and intellect, in comedy and fantasy approaching the goal of
the Elizabethan spirit. Greene, it must be acknowledged, opened
some veins that no one followed up; some of his characters and
much of his sympathies were his own in an unshared way; but his
work of all kinds ended with him, and, so far as he was an explorer
of the way, he was most like one who, in our own time, may be an
experimenter in some new force&mdash;his name is not associated with
scientific history, with new invention, with discovery, but such success
as he had was because his eye was on the element which men
of his craft were working out more thoroughly than he himself.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to close this brief note on one of the most unfortunate
of men whom our literature remembers, with a kindlier appreciation
of him than has hitherto obtained. The mere volume of
his writings indicates great industry; the criticism of them witnesses
our respect for his endowments, his taste, his fundamental
manhood; the analysis of them shows improvement in himself, and
the power of mastery over the material given him in the direction
of the true progress of art in his day; the very violence of his fate
or of his repentances suggests that the nature so ruined may have
been of finer and better metal than those who died and made no
such sign of conscious self-obstruction: there remain the ideal
women, the clear-cut comedians, the lovely lyrics, to plead for him
as an accomplisher of art; and, in view of this, may we not forget
the unhappy incident that has made him like the flitting bat in the
slow dawn of our golden poet, and remember the much that he,
dying so young, at thirty-two, accomplished before the day of his
disappointment, the night of his deserted solitude, and the tragic
ignominy of his death?</p>

<h3> CRITICAL ESSAY </h3>

<p><b>Life.</b><a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>&mdash;Robert Greene was born in Norwich of estimable parents, and
"in his non-age" sent there to school. He was entered November 15, 1575,
at St. John's, Cambridge. According to his <i>Short Discourse</i>, he was even
then "in his first yeares." We may, therefore, date his birth about 1560.
At the university he "light amongst wags" as lewd as himself, and was by
them drawn, probably after he had taken his B.A., 1578, "to travell into
Italy and Spaine," where he "practizde such villainie as is abhominable to
declare." After his return (probably before Part I. of his <i>Mamillia</i> was
entered for printing, October 3, 1580,&mdash;certainly by March 20, 1581,
when his ballad of <i>Youthe</i><a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> was registered), he "ruffeled out in silks" posing
as "malcontent"; but having in 1583,<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> "by degrees proceeded M.A.," he
betook himself to London, where as "Author of Playes and penner of Love
Pamphlets" none soon was better known "than Robin Greene." Perhaps
he was in Cambridge, September 6, 1583, when the <i>Second Part of Mamillia</i>
was registered, for it is dated "from my Studie in Clare hall." Till about
August 13, 1584, he was writing similar tales; and, despite a dissolute habit,
he maintained favour with some of honourable calling. His <i>Planetomachia</i>
appeared in 1585; an edition of his <i>Morando</i><a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> is licensed during the next
year. Between 1584 and 1586 he visited his former home, made a fleeting
effort at reform, married a "proper young woman" of Lincolnshire,<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> had a
son by her, "cast her off," and returned to London. Here he gave himself
"wholly to the penning of plaies," which with "other trifling pamphlets"
were henceforth his "chiefest stay of living." Both kinds brought him popularity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
and envy.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>
In July, 1588, he was incorporated M.A. at Oxford. In
February, 1589, this "arch play-making poet" steps forth in the rôle of
patriot with his <i>Spanish Masquerado</i>; soon after with his <i>Mourning Garment</i>
(<i>S. R.</i> November 2, 1590) in that of moralist. The didactic note had been
already struck in <i>The Royal Exchange</i>, early in 1590, and the penitential
in the <i>Farewell to Follie</i> (S. R. 1587; pub. 1591); but both prevail
in <i>Never Too Late</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> 1590. The disposition to serve the Commonwealth is
further displayed in his series for the exposure of "coosnage," 1591-92.
Whatever else he had written he now counts for "apples of Sodom." In
July, 1592, he<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> "canvazed" the brothers Harvey in his <i>Quip for an Upstart
Courtier</i>, but of this we have only the eviscerated remains. Soon afterward
he indulged in that memorable surfeit of pickled herring and Rhenish wine.
The ensuing sickness at the shoemaker's in Dowgate,&mdash;Greene's friendless
lot, "lousie circumstance," mistresse,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> bastard, and corpse,&mdash;Gabriel Harvey<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>
has embalmed with the foul peculiar juices of his spite. Those last
weeks Greene spent writing his <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i> which is partly, and
his <i>Repentance</i> which is wholly, autobiographical, to dissuade men from a like
"carelesse course of life." He sent back their son to his wife; and the night
of his death received "commendations" from her "whereat he greatly rejoiced,"
and wrote a pathetic farewell. That was September 3, 1592.
Mrs. Isam, his hostess, garlanded the dead poet with bays; and he was
laid in the New Churchyard, near Bedlam.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Misapprehensions concerning Greene.</b>&mdash;On the title-page of <i>Planetomachia</i>,
1585, Greene subscribes himself "Student in Phisicke";
and from this it has been inferred by most of his biographers
that he was then studying medicine. But for Greene, as for
Chaucer and Gower, whom he diligently perused, 'phisicke' sometimes
meant natural philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> and always included a grounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
 in 'astronomie.'<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
The word is here used with reference to the
'magic natural' of his subject,&mdash;the book being a narrative dispute
of astrological influences.</p>

<p>According to popular assertion, substantiated by the arguments
of Dyce, Fleay, Grosart, and others, Greene was at one period a
parson. Careful investigation convinces me that this assertion is
untrue. Our dramatist cannot have been the Robert Greene who,
as <i>unus Capellanorum nostrorum Capellæ nostræ Regiæ</i>, was in 1576
presented by Elizabeth to the rectory of Walkington in Yorkshire;
for at that time he was but a freshman at Cambridge. Nor can
he<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> have been the Robert Greene who from June 19, 1584, to
February 17, 1586, was Vicar of Tollesbury in Essex; because
according to his own story,<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> that period was covered by other events:
to wit, the conviction of sin in St. Andrew's at Norwich (while he
was yet "newly come from Italy," end of 1584 or beginning of
1585), a "motion" which vastly amused his "copesmates," but lasted
"<i>no longer than the present time</i>"; the relapse; the marriage "soon
after to a gentleman's daughter" (sometime in 1585); the brief
sequel of "wickedness" during which he "spent up" his wife's
marriage-money; the "casting off" of the wife; and the return to
play-writing in London. This last, six years before his death;
therefore in 1586. Such manner of life is not that of the Vicar of
Tollesbury; nor is the recital that of Greene if he ever was vicar
of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. Fleay<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> attempts to identify Greene, as Robert <i>the parson</i>,
with one Robert Persj or Rupert Persten of Leicester's troupe
acting between December, 1585, and July, 1587, on the Continent.
There is, however, no proof that Greene was with these "instrumentalists
and acrobats"; nor is the name <i>Persj</i> or <i>Persten</i>, as it
appears in the Danish and Saxon records, either the English name
<i>Parson</i> or a translation of the calling of parson into Danish or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>German. Actor King became <i>Koning</i> and <i>Konigk</i>, and actor Pope,
<i>Pape</i> and <i>Pabst</i>,&mdash;but Persj, Percy, Persten, or Preston was untranslatable.
Indeed, if the argument proves anything, it proves too
much. For if Mr. Fleay's Persten (or as he coerces it, <i>Priester)</i>
is Greene, Vicar of Tollesbury, this Vicar must have been acting
abroad three months of the period during which he was preaching at
home;&mdash;a dual activity terminated, moreover, not by the vestry
of Tollesbury, which would appear to have enjoyed this unusual
programme, or by the bishop, but by the Vicar himself, whose
resignation is recorded as "free and spontaneous."<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>It is certainly safer to accept Greene's own story and the publishers'
records, which, taken together, show that his marital estate
was a debauch with rare intervals of business activity. During this
period <i>Arbasto</i> and the enlarged <i>Morando</i> were registered and <i>Planetomachia</i>
was printed.</p>

<p>A writer of Greene's self-exhibitive temper would not have
hesitated, and one of his didactic tendency could not have failed,
to present the world with an account of an episode which, if it
existed, was the most sensational of his moral experiences. But in
none of his writings, autobiographical, or quasi-autobiographical,
does Greene give even remote intimation of taking orders. On the
contrary he speaks as a layman, and a very wicked layman, too; as
one who from infancy was bred in sin, and who held aloof from
God's ministers. So far was he from the possibility of orders that
when, in his youth, "once and yet but once" he "sorrowed for
his wickedness of life," his comrades could conceive of no huger joke
in the world than to wish that he "might have a pulpit." <i>Roberto</i>
of the <i>Groatsworth</i>, "whose life in most part agreed" with his, was
never a minister, nor was either of Greene's other understudies,
<i>Philador</i> and <i>Francesco</i>. In <i>Greene's Vision</i>, which, whether authentic
or not, is contemporaneous, the advice given to our dramatist "Be a
devine, my sonne," is dismissed as out of the question, though that
consummation were most devoutly to be desired. None of his associates
of later years<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> betrays acquaintance with his ministerial career,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>not Nashe or Burbye or Dekker or Heywood or Chettle. None of
his panegyrists. And of his enemies not even Gabriel Harvey.</p>

<p>We may therefore conclude that the famous passage in <i>Martine
Marsixtus</i> which (with a context partly relative to Greene) announces
that "every red-nosed minister is an author" does not apply to
Greene, but to any "unauthorized author who serves a drunken
man's humor," or that the insinuation has reference to some sobriquet
born of Greene's paroxysms of pentitence and mourning pamphlets.
And, indeed, a nickname may have attached itself to this
wayward child of circumstance, as early as that critical period in
Norwich when his copesmates called him "Puritane and Presizian
... and other such scoffing tearmes." What more likely
than "Parson," since they had gone so far, Greene tells us, as to
<i>wish</i> him a pulpit? But if he had a pulpit, what becomes of the
joke? and of his own word&mdash;"the good lesson went quite out of
my remembrance ... I went forward obstinately in my misse"?</p>

<p>As to the manuscript notes in the 1599 copy of <i>The Pinner of
Wakefield</i>, the first of which states that Shakespeare said that the
play was "written by ... a minister who ac[ted] ye piñers pt in it
himself," and the second, in another hand, that Juby said that "ys
play was made by Ro. Gree[ne],"&mdash;it must be remembered that
both attributions are hearsay; that both notes are anonymous;
that one or both may be fraudulent; that there is no certain proof
that they were written by contemporaries; and finally that, unless
their contents are shown to be accurate as well as authentic, and
to refer to the same author, they do not connect any Robert Greene
with the ministry. Since our Greene's writings show that he was
no minister, there is but one hypothesis upon which, assuming the
accuracy and relevancy of both these manuscript notes, he can be
the person indicated; namely, that the designation, minister, used
by Shakespeare, was a nickname. And, conversely, Shakespeare's
remark can be credited in its literal significance only if the play was
<i>not</i> by our Greene. In the latter event, the attribution of authorship
to a minister, taken in connection with Ed. Juby's attribution
to a certain Ro. Greene, would denote some parson-playwright to
whom no other play has been traced&mdash;Robert of Walkington, or
Robert of Tollesbury, or some other of this not unusual name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
And in that case it would be easy to understand how the name of
an obscure author, if mentioned by Shakespeare, should have slipped
the memory of the title-page scribe. Internal evidence, as will
later be seen, is not conclusive of Greene's authorship; but even if
it were, it would not prove that he was a minister.</p>

<p>It may be conceded that, like other Elizabethan dramatists, he
assumed a part upon the stage. But that he adopted the calling, or
ever stood a chance of enjoying "its damnable excessive gains," is
only less improbable than that he was a parson. Dyce's quotation
from Harvey to the effect that Greene was "a player" misapprehends
the "puissant epitapher" who was merely enumerating the
"thousand crotchets" that littered Greene's "wilde head, and
hence his stories."<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> None of his contemporaries hints that Greene
was an actor; none regards him in that light. He himself despised
the profession.</p>

<p>In respect of his relations with Shakespeare, I cannot but feel
that he has been harshly judged. We shall be justified in calling
the <i>Shakescene</i> remarks unduly rancorous when it has been ascertained
that the "admired inventions" of Greene and of those whom
he was addressing in the <i>Groatsworth</i> had not been borrowed by the
young actor-playwright; or that Greene should have let himself
be plundered without protest by this revamper of plays because the
revamper was destined some day to be illustrious, in fact to be the
Shakespeare. I have not observed that dramatists <i>et id omne genus</i>,
nowadays, offer the cheek with any more Christian grace than
characterized Robert Greene.</p>

<p><b>His Development as a Dramatist: Order of Plays.</b><a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>&mdash;A painstaking
investigation of the evidence leads me to conclude that none of
the plays assigned to Greene was produced before the end of 1586,
or, probably, the beginning of 1587; that their order is as follows:
<i>Alphonsus</i>, <i>Looking-Glasse</i>, <i>Orlando</i>, <i>Friar Bacon</i>, <i>James IV.</i>;
and that if <i>Selimus</i> and the <i>Pinner</i> are his, they range respectively
with <i>Alphonsus</i> and <i>James</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>

 1. The earliest extant exemplar of <i>The Comicall Historie of
Alphonsus, King of Aragon</i>, by R. G.,<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> and without motto, "as it hath
bene sundrie times acted" was "brinted" by Thomas Creede, London,
1599. The play is generally supposed to have been written
in emulation of the <i>Tamburlaine</i>, which was on the stage in 1588,&mdash;perhaps,
indeed, as early as the end of 1586.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> While similarity of
diction and conceit might indicate a contemporaneous production,
the lines in <i>Alphonsus</i>,&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Not mighty Tamburlaine,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor soldiers trained up amongst the wars,"<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">are proof presumptive of the priority of Marlowe's play. Indeed,
Dr. Grosart is justified in asserting that "to take <i>Alphonsus</i> without
a tacit reference to <i>Tamburlaine</i> is to miss the entire impulse of its
writer"; for the dramatist appears to be attempting a burlesque;
and the vainglorious claim that he makes for his hero<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> is a manifest
challenge to Marlowe and that bombastic brood. Greene may
have been writing the play as early as 1587; he was, at any rate,
interested in the hero then, for he mentions him in the <i>Dedication</i> to
<i>The Carde of Fancie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> That the <i>Alphonsus</i> was well known in the
early spring of 1589 would appear from an allusion in Peele's <i>Farewell</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>
which couples it with <i>Tamburlaine</i> so closely as further to
suggest that it already clung like a burr to its magniloquent predecessor.
Whether the series of satiric reprisals in which, between
1588 and 1590, Greene and Nashe indulged at Marlowe's expense,<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
was stimulated by some counter-burlesque of <i>Alphonsus</i> is uncertain;
but that Marlowe shortly before March 29, 1588, had been privy
to some public burlesque of a production of Greene's, may reasonably
be inferred from Greene's preface to the <i>Perymedes</i> of that date.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>For there we learn that two "gentlemen poets" had recently caused
two actors to make a mockery of his motto <i>Omne tulit punctum</i>,
because his verse fell short of the bombast and blasphemy with
which Marlowe captivated the vulgar. If it was the verse of the
<i>Alphonsus</i> that was derided by these "madmen of Rome," we have
here a date before which the play had been both acted and burlesqued.
Now, it is interesting to note that our earliest copy of
<i>Alphonsus</i> (1599) has neither motto nor colophon. This is strange,
for in all other respects the edition is uniform with that of <i>James IV.</i>,
which had been brought out by the same publisher, Creede, only
the year before, with Greene's <i>Omne tulit punctum</i> upon its title-page.
In fact, all other plays written by Greene alone, and bearing
his name, have a motto of some kind. One may naturally query
whether it was to Creede's advantage to dissociate this particular
play from some eleven or twelve years' old derision; or, whether he
was following, without definite purpose, the policy of some previous
edition, now lost, which likewise had omitted the motto.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there is, in the preface of March 29, 1588,
undoubted allusion<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> to Greene and Lodge's <i>Looking-Glasse</i>, which,
as will presently be shown, was written before June, 1587. The
<i>Alphonsus</i> must be assigned to a still earlier date, because, in its prologue,<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>
it gives evidence of priority to Greene's other efforts in
serious or heroic style. This conclusion is confirmed by an examination
of the play. The copious crude employment of mythological
lore, the creaking mechanism of the plot, the subordination
of vital to spectacular qualities, betray an inexperience not manifest
in Greene's other dramatic output. Moreover, in spite of
the fact that our edition of <i>Alphonsus</i> appears to preserve the details
of the author's holograph, the versification makes a clumsier showing
than in the rest of his plays. The lines are frequently
rhymed, sometimes within the speeches, but more often in a perfunctory
fashion at speech-ends. And, though this practice wanes
as the play proceeds, the verses are throughout more frequently endstopped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
and the rhythm more mechanical, than in the other dramas.
Between two-thirds and three-quarters of the lines have the monotonous
cæsura at the end of the second foot; and of the lyric cæsuræ,
which should <i>par excellence</i> lend variety to the verse, about
eleven-twelfths fall in the middle of the third foot. We may
indeed say that in four-fifths of the lines these sources of sameness
prevail. Of prose there is no sign. Both in material and
style the play is inelastic, only too easily open to attack. That
Greene should prefix the <i>Omne tulit punctum</i> of his popular prose
romances was natural, but it was also courting the attack of
Marlowe, Kyd, or any gentleman-poets derisively inclined.</p>

<p>2. <i>A Looking-Glasse for London and England</i> made by Thomas
Lodge, Gentleman, and Robert Greene, <i>in Artibus Magister</i>, is
called by Professor Brown the "finest and last" of the plays in which
Greene had a hand, and is assigned to a date "after Lodge's return
from Cavendish's expedition in 1591." This conjecture may at once
be dismissed,<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> for that expedition did not start till August 26, 1591;
none of its ships returned before June 11, 1593; and, by that time,
Greene was dead. The play was registered in May, 1594, and
our earliest exemplar (Creede) was printed in the same year.
Henslowe records the presentation of the play, but not as new,
March 8, 1591-92. We have abundant proof of its popularity.
Therefore, since only four representations are recorded during the
remainder of that season, which lasted till June 22, 1592,<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> it must
have had its run at an earlier date. Spencer's line in <i>The Tears of
the Muses</i>, 1591, about the "pleasing Alcon" has been regarded as
an allusion to Lodge's authorship of that character in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>;
and with some show of reason, for nearly all the speeches
of Alcon are distinctively the work of Lodge.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> But an earlier reminiscence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
 of the play may be found in Greene's mention of Ninevie
and Jonas in the dedication and epilogue of the <i>Mourning Garment</i>,
1590. Since it appears, moreover, from a passage in <i>Scillaes Metamorphosis</i>,
that Lodge had renounced play-writing as early as 1589,<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>
Storojenko and Grosart date the composition of <i>Looking-Glasse</i>
between the close of 1588 and the summer of 1589. I am sure
that the date was earlier still; for, since the <i>Metamorphosis</i> followed
immediately upon Lodge's return from a voyage with Captain
Clarke to Tercera and the Canaries, any such playwriting as that
of the <i>Looking-Glasse</i> must have been done before the departure of
this expedition. According to Mr. Lee,<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> the Expedition sailed
"about 1588." Now the play contains no allusion to the Armada;
it is, therefore, antecedently improbable that it was written in 1588
<i>later than the 29th of May</i>. And since a modernized morality of
God's wrath impending over London, if written in that year,
could not have failed to echo the first mutterings of the Spanish
thunderstorm, I am led to fix the composition before June, 1587,
when Philip and Sixtus concluded their treaty against England.</p>

<p>The date of first presentation must have been appreciably before
March 29, 1588, for a character, the 'priest of the sun,' which
figured in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>, but "in no other early play,"<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> is
mentioned in the introduction to <i>Perymedes</i>, already cited. Here,
Greene asserts that even if his verse did not always "jet upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>stage in tragicall buskins," or his "<i>everie</i> worde" blaspheme, he
could, an he pleased, fill the mouth "like the fa-burden of Bo-Bell,
daring God out of heaven with that Atheist Tamburlan"; and,
by way of proof, he sets side by side with Tamburlan, the impious
ranting of his own "mad preest of the Sonne." The reference is,
of course, to the scene in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>, where the mitred
priests of the sun, "carrying fire in their hands," hail Rasni as a
"deitie";<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> and he assumes that the mention of one of the characters
will indicate the play,&mdash;a justifiable expectation if the play
had been before the public for nine or ten months.</p>

<p>Though affected by its moral configuration, the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>
is well constructed. In plot, characterization, manners (especially
those of low life), in worldly wisdom and fervour, it leaves <i>Alphonsus</i>
far behind. The subtler handling of classical adornment and
the bubble of the humour would, of themselves, justify us in assigning
it to the same period with <i>Orlando</i> and <i>Friar Bacon</i>. The
advancing maturity is manifest also in its verse and prose. I do
not attribute Greene's improvement in blank verse entirely to
Lodge's coöperation; for Lodge's verse in the <i>Civill War</i>, 1587,
was not markedly easier than that of the <i>Alphonsus</i>, and his verse in
this play<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>
is but a trifle more elastic than in the <i>Civill War</i>. Taking
at random fifty-seven of Greene's verses,<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> I find that some fifty-two
avoid the monotone, and, of these, no fewer than twenty-five
escape the penthimimeral cæsura as well. In other words, five-sixths
of the rhythms are free, and one-half of these skilfully varied.
In the prophetic verses the monotone is properly more prevalent.
About thirty per cent of Greene's have it. But even there almost
half of the 'free' rhythms display artistic handling. Speech-end
rhythms are fewer than in <i>Alphonsus</i>; rhyme, indeed, is altogether
less in evidence&mdash;except in the prophetic rhapsodies. Lodge's
lines for Oseas rhyme, however, more than Greene's for Jonas.
Not only is the proportion of prose larger than in any other of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>Greene's plays,&mdash;a feature which is, perhaps, due to the fact that
each collaborator had his own set of mechanicals to exploit,&mdash;but the
style of it is more conversational than in any preceding English play.</p>

<p>3. Our earliest impression of <i>Orlando Furioso, One of the Twelve
Peeres of France</i>, "as it was playd before the Queenes Maiestie,"
is published by Burbye, 1594. It had been entered for Danter,
December 7, 1593, but was transferred to Burbye on the ensuing
May 28. He issued a second edition in 1599.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> Greene was
accused in 1592<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> of having sold the play to the Lord Admiral's
men while the Queen's company, to which he had previously disposed
of it, was "in the country." Now the Queen's men had
acted at court for the last time, December 26, 1591; and they
did not reappear in London till April, 1593.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> But the Admiral's,
meanwhile (February, 1592), had entered into a temporary alliance
with Lord Strange's,<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> through Henslowe and Edw. Alleyn; and
under the auspices of the latter company almost immediately
(February 21) the <i>Orlando</i> was acted in one of Henslowe's theatres.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>
It was already an old play; and Henslowe records no later performance.
During the same period three or four other plays formerly
belonging to the Queen's passed into the hands of Lord Strange's
company.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> The date of the second sale of <i>Orlando</i> would accordingly
seem to have been during January or February, 1592. It
appears, then, that up to December 26, 1591, it belonged to the
Queen's men; and it had probably been presented at court by them,
for its classical and Italian features were evidently from the first
designed to suit her Majesty's taste.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<p>That the play was written later than July 30, 1588, may be
deduced from a mention (ll. 89-95) of the "rebate" of "mightie
Fleetes" which "Came to subdue my Ilands to their king;" for
the allusion to the Armada is historically minute (note the conjunction
of 'Portingale' with 'Spaniard' in reference to the start from
Lisbon), the sequence does not savour of afterthought or actor's
clap-trap, and the theme receives attention in other parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>play.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> Now, between the "rebate" of the Armada and the disappearance
of the Queen's men from London that company acted
at court ten times;<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> and upon at least one of these occasions I
conclude that the <i>Orlando</i> was played. During the year that
followed the Armada there are but two such occasions on record,
December 26, 1588, and February 9, 1589; and of the latter the
notice is open to question.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> In any case the former is more likely
to be the date of the presentation of <i>Orlando</i>; for the reference to
the Armada, and the championing of Elizabeth under the figure
of Angelica, would be the policy of a court play acted on the St.
Stephen's day following the Spanish defeat. If this was the play,
we may be sure that it won her Majesty's approval; and that the
dramatist seized the opportunity to further his good fortune. And
that is precisely what Greene did. In February, 1589, he brought
out his <i>Spanish Masquerado</i>, which was hailed with such enthusiasm
that his friend Lodge declared that the name of Greene was become
a terror to the <i>gens seditieux</i>, that his laurel was deathless, and that
from a mortal he had become a companion of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> Now
I incline to think that the success of <i>Orlando</i> contributed to this
popularity; there is certainly not enough of political or literary
worth in the <i>Masquerado</i> alone to account for it. There is further
reason for dating the <i>Orlando</i> before 1590 if the resemblances
between it and the <i>Old Wives Tale</i><a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> are due, as I think they are,
to Peele's acquaintance with the former. And if, in his <i>Farewell</i>,
the same poet is alluding to our play, under the title of <i>Charlemagne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>&mdash;which,
considering Orlando's frequent brag of kinship with the
emperor, is not unlikely,&mdash;the play must have been acted before
the spring of 1589. That Greene was occupied with the <i>Orlando</i> at
a still earlier date would appear from his repeating in it no less than
five of the character-names which he had used in one of the stories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>of the <i>Perymedes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> Nor does the tracing of certain resemblances to
their common source in the epos lessen the general probability that
Greene's story and play were written at approximately the same
period; the latter following, as the former had preceded, the summer
of 1588. Mr. Fleay would, indeed, push the date back to 1587
"when the Admiral's men re-opened after the plague,"<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> and Professor
Brown sets it with that of <i>Alphonsus</i> and <i>Bacon</i>, between 1584
and 1587;<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> but I do not think that the contents warrant either of
these conclusions.</p>

<p>Though the <i>Orlando</i> must be of later date than the <i>Alphonsus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> it
betrays the influence of the still earlier <i>Tamburlaine</i>. But it is more
than a sensational or spectacular play; it is a parody of the ranting
"mad plays" which were then the rage. Numerous characteristics
which appear to some critics to be defects of construction are proof
of this. Orlando's sudden insanity and the ridiculously inadequate
occasion of it, the headlong <i>dénouement</i>, the farcical technique, the
mock-heroic atmosphere, the paradoxical absence of pathos, the
absurdly felicitous conclusion,&mdash;all seemingly unwitting,&mdash;are
purposive and satirical. Of such a burlesque the author of <i>The
Spanish Tragedy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> perhaps of the pre-Shakespearian <i>Hamlet</i>, may
have been the butt. Greene and Nashe had no affection for Kyd.
The raving and bombast of this play&mdash;the stuff, too, that the actor
Alleyn injected&mdash;suggest a parody of Kyd; and the dates accord.
At any rate I think it likely that the <i>Orlando</i><a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> was produced while
the pre-Shakespearian <i>Hamlet</i> was fresh; and this consideration
also looks toward 1588.</p>

<p>Many similarities of style may be pointed out between <i>Orlando</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>and other of Greene's productions during 1588 and 1589.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> The
resemblances to <i>Friar Bacon</i> not merely in diction, imagery, and
allusion,<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> but in quality of verse, are numerous. In respect of this
last the plays may be considered together since they are of a piece.
They were apparently written within a year of each other, both
with a view to presentation at Court.</p>

<p>4. The earliest impression of <i>The Honorable Historie of frier Bacon
and frier Bongay</i> (as it was plaid by her Maiesties servants) is of
1594, and was printed for Edward White, in whose name (substituted
for Adam Islip's, erased) it had been entered, S. R. May 14,
of the same year.<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> The earliest record of its presentation is Henslowe's
of 1591-92: "Rd at fryer bacone, the 19 of febrary, satter-daye
... xvijˢ iij.ᵈ" The play is first in the list of those performed
by "my Lord Strange's men"; but is not marked "new." It is,
however, a drawing play: Strange's men act it about once every
three weeks, between February 19 and May 6; and once a week,
between the ensuing January 10 and January 30, while Queen's
and Sussex act it twice in an engagement of a week beginning
April 1, 1593-94. It must have preceded the anonymous play
<i>Faire Em, the Miller's Daughter of Manchester</i>, which imitates it<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>&mdash;perhaps
with ironic intent. Indeed, <i>Bacon</i> would seem to have been
acted as much as twelve months before <i>Faire Em</i> appeared. For
in Greene's Epistle (about the middle of 1591) prefixed to the
<i>Farewell to Follie</i>, where he reproaches the imitating dramatist with
general lack of invention and with profane borrowing from the
Scriptures, he further twits him with having consumed "a whole
year" in "enditing" his foolish and inartistic play.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> That is to
say, a whole year from the production of the play which it so evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
 imitated. Now, what was the date of <i>Faire Em</i>? If, as
Professor Schick<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> points out, its main source was Jacques Yvers's
<i>Printemps d'Iver</i>, it would probably follow the fresh editions of that
book of 1588 and 1589. And it did. I place its date between
that of Greene's <i>Address to the Gentlemen Schollers</i> prefixed to the
<i>Mourning Garment</i> and that of the <i>Address</i> prefixed to his <i>Farewell</i>.
For in the former he undertakes to forestall, in general, the "fooles"
who may "scoffe" at his repentance, and in the latter while he makes
a show of ignoring the "asses" that "strike" at him (<i>i.e.</i> at his
<i>Mourning Garment</i>) he specifies one "ass" who may be expected
to flout his <i>Farewell</i>, viz., the author of <i>Faire Em</i>,&mdash;that being
indicated by quotations. In other words the <i>Faire Em</i> is to be
dated between November 2, 1590 (when the <i>Mourning Garment</i>
was registered),<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> and the middle of 1591 (when the <i>Farewell</i> with
this prefatory <i>Address</i>) appeared.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> Since the "blasphemous rhetoricke"
of <i>Faire Em</i> was well known when Greene criticised it, we may
suppose that the play had been in existence since November or
December, 1590. And if its author had been "a whole year
enditing" this imitation of <i>Friar Bacon, Friar Bacon</i> must have been
a notable play in November or December, 1589. But if <i>Englands
Mourninge Gowne</i>, which was registered July 1, 1590, be Greene's
<i>Mourning Garment</i> under another name,<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> then <i>Faire Em</i> may have
appeared as early as July or August of the same year; and <i>Friar
Bacon</i>, preceding <i>Faire Em</i> by a twelvemonth, might be dated July or
August, 1589. Even if we do not strictly construe Greene's
"whole year," we must allow some such opportunity for the vogue
of <i>Friar Bacon</i>, and for the composition, presentation, and vogue of
<i>Faire Em</i>, before the publication of Greene's retort in the 1591
edition of the <i>Farewell to Follie</i>. Hence the period between July
and the end of 1589 will probably cover the production of <i>Friar
Bacon</i>; but the latter limit might include the spring of 1590.</p>

<p>Mr. Fleay,<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> reasoning from the insertion of Greene's longer
motto as colophon to the 1594 exemplar, places <i>Friar Bacon</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>earlier than the <i>Menaphon</i> (S. R. August 23, 1589), in which he says
Greene's shorter motto<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> is first used. Of the validity of this test I
am not convinced. Much more convincing is the argument based
by the same indefatigable scholar upon a date suggested within the
drama. St. James's Day, July 25, is mentioned (Sc. i.) as falling on
a Friday. Mr. Fleay insists that in such cases dramatic authors
used the almanac for the current year; and he shows that 1589 is
the only year of such coincidence that will meet the conditions of
this play. Since the attribution of the exact day of the week to a
movable feast is more likely to follow than to precede the observance,
I should regard July 25, 1589, the limit before which the
<i>Bacon</i> was not finished. Now, not only the eulogy of Elizabeth at
the end, but the euphuistic and classical style of the play, shows
that it was intended for presentation at court. The only dates
within the limits above prescribed on which the Queen's men played
before her Majesty were December 26, 1589, and March 1, 1590.
I lean to the former, St. Stephen's Day, as that on which <i>Friar
Bacon</i> was performed.</p>

<p>The relation of this play to <i>Dr. Faustus</i> throws additional light
upon the question under discussion. We must first eliminate the
assumption that Marlowe's "wall of brass"<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> was borrowed from
<i>Friar Bacon</i>. The sources of the conception were common to
both playwrights: the <i>Famous Historie of frier Bacon</i>, a story-book
popular at the time, and "the tradition already borrowed from
Giraldus Cambrensis by Spenser."<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> And it is evident that Marlowe
drew the scene where Robin conjures with one of Faustus's
books directly from the story-book, not at all from Greene's play.<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>
I agree with Dr. Ward that Greene's play was suggested by Marlowe's,
and that "it is hardly too great an assumption to regard
Bacon's victory over Vandermast as a cheery outdoing by genuine
English magic of the pretentious German article in which Faustus
was the representative traveller." Greene's play is a romantic but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>humorous, sometimes burlesque, treatment of a theme like Marlowe's,
but familiar to the audience, and attractive because domestic.
It may, indeed, be surmised that some scenes in <i>Friar Bacon</i> are
parodies of their pompous analogues in <i>Dr. Faustus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> I think it
has not been noticed that in the title of Greene's play we have a
clue to his intention: the 'Honorable Historie' is in evident contrast
with the 'Tragical Historie' of Dr. Faustus. For the word
'honorable' was not derived from the title of the story-book. That
is a 'Famous Historie.' If he had acted in accordance with custom,
Greene might have replaced 'famous' by 'comical,' to indicate
the fortunate ending of his fable. No other drama that I
know of, up to 1589, had been denominated an 'honorable' history.
But, in this case, Greene had every provocation to emphasize
the quality 'honorable.' For his purpose was to vaunt the
superiority of the English magician above the tragically concluding
German.</p>

<p>This consideration confirms the assignment of <i>Friar Bacon</i> to
some time within a year after the production of <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (1588
<i>end</i> or 1589 <i>beginning</i>). So, also, the resemblances in style to
Greene's other writings of that period. The love theme in <i>Friar
Bacon</i> is similar to that in <i>Tullie's Love</i> (1589); the style is akin to
that of <i>Orlando</i> (December, 1588). These two are also closely
related as dramatic productions. The earlier, to be sure, confines
itself more narrowly to the satirical intent, while the later aims
in æsthetic respects, also, to surpass its Marlowan predecessor. It
is, consequently, an improvement upon <i>Orlando</i> in construction and
characterization. The dramatist is now working with free hand,
and, for the first time in this field, employs the ease and invention
for which, as a story-teller, he was already famous. In versification
these two plays continue the methods of the <i>Looking-Glasse;</i>
but the rhymed lines are sensibly fewer. In <i>Orlando</i> they appear
at the end of the first half-dozen speeches; in <i>Friar Bacon</i> they are
to seek. In both plays, about three-quarters of the verses avoid
the singsong pause at the end of the second foot. In the <i>Orlando,</i>
I should say that more than a third of the verses escape, in addition,
the penthimimeral cæsura; in the <i>Friar Bacon</i>, almost a third.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
The dodecasyllable with which Greene is experimenting in the
interest of freedom, is somewhat frequent in both plays. For the
reason already given, there is not so much prose as in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>,
perhaps only half as much. Still, of <i>Orlando</i>, one-fifth is
written in prose, and of <i>Friar Bacon</i> nearly a fourth.</p>

<p>5. Storojenko<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> holds that <i>The Scottish Historie of James the Fourth</i>
betrays a novel tendency toward native themes and simple style, and
that, with <i>Bacon</i> and <i>The Pinner</i>, it furnished the model for Shakespeare's
romantic comedies. Professor Brown, pointing out that
<i>James IV.</i> is "among the first plays to have an acted prologue and
interplay," thinks that Shakespeare followed Greene's example in
the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> and the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>; and
he groups <i>James IV.</i> with <i>The Pinner</i> and the <i>Looking-Glasse</i> as later
than the three other plays of Greene, and free from their "alluring
pedantry."<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> But we have already seen that the <i>Looking-Glasse</i> preceded
both <i>Orlando</i> and <i>Bacon</i>; and I think it can be proved that
<i>James IV.</i> followed them. The unique exemplar, printed by
Creede, "as it hath bene sundrie times publikely plaide," is of
1598, and is probably a reprint of a lost edition of 1594.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> Henslow
makes no mention of the play; nor have we record of its
acting. Storojenko conjectures some date after the summer of
1589 for its composition; Brown, some date between 1587 and
1592; Ward, about 1590; Fleay, after August 23, 1589,<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>
because it uses the shorter motto (but elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> 1591&mdash;probably
in collaboration with Lodge).</p>

<p>The following observations will, I think, fix the limits as 1590-1591.
Ida's lines, 270-279 in Act I., beginning "And weele I
wot, I heard a shepheard sing,"<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> are a reminiscence of the <i>Heard-groome
wᵗ his strawberrie lasse</i> in Peele's <i>Hunting of Cupid</i>: "What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>thing is love? for (wel I wot) love is a thing," etc.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> Notice the
recurrence in Drummond's version of the "weele I wot." The
"shepheard" to whom Ida has reference is, of course, one of
the swains of the <i>Hunting</i>, or Peele himself. The <i>Hunting</i> was not
registered for printing till July 26, 1591; but then with the proviso
"that if it be hurtful to any other copy before licensed ...
this to be void." The proviso was frequently mere form, but it
suggests that Greene may have drawn the verses from a manuscript
copy, or from the public performance before July 26, 1591. I
do not think that the <i>Hunting</i> was written very long before it was
registered, because the atmosphere and phraseology are still fresh
in Peele's mind when he writes his <i>Descensus Astrææ</i>, October, 1591.
But it is interesting to note that there occurs a premonition or echo
of these same verses on Love in Greene's <i>Mourning Garment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>
which had been registered in 1590, from eight to twelve months
before the registration of the <i>Hunting</i>. We may, with reasonable
latitude, assign the composition of the <i>Hunting</i> to the year 1590,
and that of <i>James IV</i>. to a later date in proximity to that of
Greene's <i>Mourning Garment</i>&mdash;say about July, 1590. Confirmation
of this conclusion may be found in other resemblances of sentiment
and style between <i>James IV</i>. and the <i>Mourning Garment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> as
well as in Dorothea's reference to the Irish wars, which may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>been suggested by the contemporary rising in Fermanagh; for, since
the suppression of Desmond, in 1583, there had been comparative
quiet in Ireland. Though the play exhibits little of the affected
style which Elizabeth demanded, it is courtly, and the graceful
compliment to the queen and the (English) rose in the laudation of
Dorothea's attributes, together with that heroine's forecast of a
union between Scotland and England,<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> might indicate a view to
court presentation, and a date of composition when such union was
favourably contemplated. The further boast of Dorothea:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Shall never Frenchman say an English maid</div>
<div class="i0">Of threats of forraine force will be afraid,"<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">was doubtless intended for the ear of the virgin queen, who, in
1590 and 1591, was busily landing forces in France to thwart the
schemes of her implacable enemies, the Guises. This play may,
therefore, have been presented by Greene's company, at court, on
December 26, 1590, or as one of their five performances during
1591.</p>

<p>The moral atmosphere is that of the penitential pamphlets; while
the pictures of roguery coincide with those of the conycatching
series. The portrayal of character is that of a mature dramatist;
the plot is more skilfully manipulated than in <i>Friar Bacon</i>, and
covers a larger canvas; but, though it smacks of the folk, it has
hardly the simple domestic interest of that drama. Still, Ward
calls it the happiest, Brown the most perfect, of Greene's plays; in
fact, "the finest Elizabethan historical play outside of Shakespeare."</p>

<p>The versification of <i>James IV.</i> gives proof of a mature quality of
experimentation. Because rhyme prevails, Collier assigned the
play to Greene's earlier period; but the criterion is inconclusive.
Though Greene conformed to the blank verse fashion as early as
1588, he made it clear, at the time, that he was no convert.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> And,
while in 1590-91 he recognizes the merits of a richer and more
varied rhythm, he is not yet convinced that rhyme should be abandoned;
in tender and gently romantic passages he counts it <i>utile</i> as
well as <i>dulce</i>. Some of the scenes in which Ida and the queen
figure are, accordingly, almost altogether rhymed. The rhythmical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>movement is, however, no less liberal than in <i>Orlando</i> and <i>Bacon</i>;
the proportion of monotone and penthimimeral is as low; and as
many as fifty per cent of the <i>cæsuræ</i> are lyrical. Fully one-quarter
of the play is in prose.</p>

<p>Having a regard only to the unquestioned plays of Greene, we
notice that his employment of dramatic prose dates from the association
with Lodge in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>; that his renunciation of
rhyme was short-lived, and that its resumption did not hamper the
freedom of rhythmical movement. In none of the later plays, however,
is the verse so elastic as in his own dramatic portions of the
<i>Looking-Glasse</i>. And there the mobility was probably due to a
desire for contrast with the prophetic monologues.</p>

<p><b>Attributions.</b>&mdash;Various other plays have, in whole or in part,
been assigned to Greene; <i>A History of Jobe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> not extant; part of
<i>The Troublesome Raigne of King John</i>,[2] and of the <i>First and Second
Parts of Henry VI.</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> <i>Fair Emm</i><a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> (with no show of reason), and
others mentioned by Dyce; <i>Titus Andronicus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> <i>The Pinner of Wakefield</i>,
<i>Selimus</i>, and <i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> We can consider
only the last three.</p>

<p>1. The earliest extant exemplar of <i>George-a-Greene, the Pinner of
Wakefield</i> is in the Duke of Devonshire's library. The author's
name does not appear. But the printer, publisher, year, vignette,
and motto (<i>Aut nunc aut nunquam</i>) are the same as on the title-page
of the 1599 <i>Orlando</i>; and the same printer, Burbye, had, in
1592, published other works of Greene: the <i>Third Part of Conny-Catching</i>
and <i>The Repentance</i>. These items do not, however, prove
anything concerning the identity of the author. The play was
entered to Burbye, April 1, 1595. We learn from the title-page
that the Sussex company acted it; and Henslowe records five of
these performances between December 29, 1593, and January 22,
1594. But, though the Sussex men soon afterwards twice assisted
Greene's former company in the presentation of <i>Friar Bacon</i>, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>do not seem at this, or any previous period, to have owned any of
the unquestioned plays of Robert Greene. Henslowe does not
mark this one 'new,' and the dramatic contents give no indication
of its date, save that one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> refers to Tamberlaine.<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>
No light is thrown upon the authorship by contemporary
publications; and, as late as Kirkman's <i>Catalogue</i>, 1661, the
play was still anonymous. It has been assigned to Greene on the
manuscript evidence which has already been shown to be inconclusive.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>
In the last resort our decision must depend upon the detection
of Greenian characteristics. Dr. Ward has observed that the
play possesses "one of Greene's most attractive notes,&mdash;a native
English freshness of colouring,"&mdash;glimpses of which may also be
had in <i>Friar Bacon</i> and <i>James IV.</i> This is true. The representation
of the characters, manners, and speech of the middle and lower
classes is such as might have contributed to Chettle's estimate
of the dramatist,&mdash;"the only comedian of a vulgar writer in this
country."<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> In the "plotting," also, of the play, no ordinary skill is
evinced, and that is the "quality," says Nashe, wherein Greene
was master of his craft.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> The material is a popular story, like the
material of <i>Friar Bacon</i>. One of the incidents, indeed, existed not
only in the popular story, but in the experience of Robert Greene
as well.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> The rhetorical style here and there affords an inkling of
this "very supporter" of native comedy: a word that seems to be
his,<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> a phrase or trick of the tongue,<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> a figure or two,<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> occasionally
a bejewelled verse,<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> and once, at least, a sentiment,&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"The sweet content of men that live in love</div>
<div class="i0">Breeds fretting humours in a restless mind."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">But in Greene's undoubted productions the Greenian attributes are
not so far to seek: the curious imagery, the precious visualizing,
the necromantic monstrous toys. With his brocaded rhetoric fancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>is captivated and judgment disarmed. He gluts each appetite in turn
with 'semblances,'&mdash;rare, remote, and meretricious. His silks are
gay with 'sparks' and margarites, redolent of sandalwood and
spice, stiff with oriental gold. They rustle richly on the ear.
The atmosphere is sense idealized; the melody, a bell. I do not
find these earmarks in <i>The Pinner</i>; nor the coloured negligence
of Greene, the studied, off-hand blush, the conscious affectation of
unconscious art. Of such devices <i>James IV.</i>, indeed, is by no means
compact; but, in its first fifth, there are four or five times as many references
to the foreign, the historical, astrological, mythical, as in all
<i>The Pinner</i>. The three or four classical allusions in <i>The Pinner</i>
are stark. But Greene's employment of the mythological is never
unattractive; it is <i>sui generis</i>. It has always a quiddity of the indirect,
the unexpected: a relish of distinction. These bald "Cæsars"
and "Helenas" of <i>The Pinner</i> are not Greene. On the contrary,
we come across many words, fashions of prose dictions and comic
devices, that savour of Lodge as we know him in the <i>Civill War</i>
and the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>, and suspect him in <i>Mucedorus</i>. The conversations
are sometimes reminiscent of Greene; but, on the whole,
they fail of his humorous indirection and his craft.</p>

<p>The verse is so vilely divided in the original that even after
Dyce's attempt at reconstruction, no basis for conclusive attribution
of authorship is available. Prose forms a large proportion;
indeed, it looks as if the author were trying to see how near prose
he might come without ceasing to produce unrhymed pentameters.
Fragmentary lines, dodecasyllables, feminine endings, and rhetorical
pauses abound. These last are to me more suggestive of Greene's
association with the play than is any other feature; for more than
once or twice they yield the genuinely Greenian rhythm.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> If
Greene had a hand in <i>The Pinner</i>, the metrical style would fix its
date just before or after <i>James IV.</i> It has the ease and variety of
<i>Bacon</i>, but is as signal an experiment in conversational blank verse
as was <i>James IV.</i> in rhymed dramatic; and it is a fairly successful
experiment.</p>

<p>2. <i>The <span class="err" title="original: Firt">First</span> Part of the Tragicall Raigne of Selimus</i> (Creede, 1594)
has been reclaimed for Greene by Dr. Grosart, principally on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>evidence of <i>England's Parnassus</i> (1600) which assigns to Greene
two passages taken from <i>Selimus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> For Dr. Grosart's presentation
of the case the reader may be referred to the Introduction to his
edition of Greene.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> It is worthy of the most careful study. Dr.
Ward after examining the interval evidence decides adversely to Dr.
Grosart's results.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> The following additional considerations incline
me to the same decision. The weight of the evidence depends, not
upon the number of passages from <i>Selimus</i> assigned by Allott to Greene,
but upon the style of each passage. In the <i>Parnassus</i>, Allott has
assigned to Greene passages from other works, which do not belong
to him; two, for instance, which have been traced to Spenser. If
the passages from <i>Selimus</i> on <i>Delaie</i> and <i>Damocles</i> have not Greene's
characteristic, then twenty such assignments do not prove that he
wrote <i>Selimus</i>. They would more logically prove that the collector,
in this as in other cases, is an uncertain guide. Now there is no
trace, not the faintest, of Greene's diction, sentiment, poetic quality,
or rhythmical form, in the tintinnabulation of the <i>Delaie</i>, or the
platitude of the <i>Damocles</i>. And so throughout the play. Neither
the defects nor the merits appear to me to be Greene's. Many of
the lines are, indeed, resonant, scholarly, and strong, but not in
Greene's quality. If the play were written by Greene, it could
not have been written later than the <i>Alphonsus</i>: stanzaic form, and
the crudities of rhythm, diction, and technique determine that; nor,
on the other hand, could it have been written earlier than the
<i>Alphonsus</i>, for with <i>Alphonsus</i> Greene <i>began</i> "to treat of bloody
Mars." It is not incumbent upon me to find an author for <i>Selimus</i>,
but I think that the probabilities indicate Lodge (<i>circa</i> 1586-87).
It has perhaps not been noted that Bullithrumble's lines (1955-1958)
about godfathers are duplicated by Lodge's Alcon in the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>
(l. 1603); and that the parlance of Bullithrumble is paralleled
by Curtall and Poppey in Lodge's <i>Civill War</i> (<i>circa</i> 1587).
The dogberryisms, clipped words, and inverted phrases of the same
character are of a piece also with those of Mouse in <i>Mucedorus</i><a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
play which has indeed so many of the idiosyncrasies that mark
the <i>Civill War</i> that Mr. Fleay is not without warrant in conjecturing
the authorship of Lodge. It should in addition be remarked
that several of the expressions which Dr. Grosart finds in <i>Selimus</i>,
and considers to be peculiarly Greene's, are to be found in the
<i>Civill War</i> and the <i>Mucedorus</i>; and that some non-Greenian characteristics
of the <i>Selimus</i> appear in one or the other of these plays.
The "to-fore," for instance, which Dr. Grosart marks as Greenian
in <i>Selimus</i> occurs four times in <i>Mucedorus</i> alone. The blank verse
of the <i>Selimus</i> finds its parallel in that of the <i>Civill War</i>; so, also,
the quaint stanzaic form, and the apparently Greenian moralizing
on 'content'<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> (ll. 2049-2053). And conversely, the profound and
easeful soliloquies and serious imagery of the <i>Civill War</i> are nearer
akin to those of the <i>Selimus</i> than to anything of Greene's.</p>

<p>3. 'Young Juvenall' and the 'Comedie lastly writ.'&mdash;"With
thee" says Greene to Marlowe in the <i>Groatsworth</i>, "I joyne young
Juvenall, that byting satirist, that lastly with mee together writ a
comedie. Sweete boy, might I advise thee," etc. Simpson and
Grosart disprove the conjecture<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> that the play was the <i>Looking-Glasse</i>
and the 'Juvenal,' Lodge: The <i>Looking-Glasse</i> had not been lately
written; the epithet 'Juvenal' did not at any time apply to Lodge;
nor would Greene, in 1592, have called him a "sweete boy" as he
calls this fellow-dramatist, for Lodge, born 1557, was thirty-five at
the time and older than Greene by three years. It is argued that
'Juvenal' was Nashe as follows: Nashe was already proficient in
satire; he had, between 1589 and 1592, published half a dozen
pasquinades which had met with immediate success; he calls himself
and is called by others 'Pasquil' or 'Aretine' or the 'railing Nashe';
and Meres in 1598 addresses him as "gallant young Juvenal" and
mentions him with Greene among the "best writers of comedie."
It must also be remembered that Nashe was 'young'&mdash;not quite
twenty-five in 1592&mdash;"and that a difference of seven years made
him a 'sweete boy' in Greene's regard."<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> To these considerations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>I add the following: First,&mdash;Chettle feigning a letter<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> from the
dead poet to Nashe (<i>Robert Greene to Pierce Pennilesse</i>), makes
Greene use almost the epithet of the <i>Groatsworth</i>, "Awake, <i>secure
boy</i>, revenge thy wrongs." It may be surmised that the older poet
was in the way of thus affectionately terming the younger, and that
Chettle, who had edited the <i>Groatsworth</i>, had the pamphlet in mind
when he conceived this letter. Second,&mdash;The pains taken by Nashe,
in his <i>Strange Newes</i>, to disclaim anything like continuous companionship
are occasioned by the fact that he and Greene had "lastly"
been "together." He writes, in September, 1592, "Since first
I knewe him [Greene] about towne, I have beene two yeares together
and not seene him."<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> The "first" refers to 1588-89 when Nashe
was championing Greene's <i>Menaphon</i> and scoring Greene's rivals in
<i>The Anatomie</i>. The "two yeares" bring us to 1591, when he was
engaged with Greene in the controversy with the Harveys<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> which
he here recounts with such detail as to indicate no slight acquaintance
with Greene's motives and movements at the time. In that
year appeared Nashe's <i>Astrological Prognostication</i>, and in the next,
Greene's <i>Quip</i>, both bearing upon the subject on hand. We may
infer that the revival of their literary association was connected
with the 'canvazing' of the rope-maker's sons.<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> Greene's concluding
counsel is such as we should expect him to give the 'young
Juvenall' with whom he had lately engaged against a common
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> Nashe informs us also that he had occasionally, of late,
caroused with the poet and that he was present at that "banquet of
Rhenish and pickled herrings" from which Greene took his death.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>
Third,&mdash;When Dekker, some fifteen years later, tells in his <i>Knight's
Conjuring</i> of the habitants of the "Fieldes of Joye," he introduces
Nashe as one of that group which is exclusively restricted to the
poets, and the editor, of Greene's <i>Groatsworth</i>. "Marlow, Greene,
and Peele," writes he, "had got under the shades of a large vyne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>laughing to see Nash [the favourite of the group, and even yet the
'sweete boy'] that was but newly come to their colledge, still
haunted with the sharpe and satyricall spirit that followed him heere
upon earth...." And why there? He had "shorten'd his dayes
by keeping company with pickle-herring" [many another night, no
doubt, than that of August, 1592, with Will Monox and Ro.
Greene,&mdash;but that night persisted]. And with what do they greet
him? "How [do] poets and players agree <i>now</i>?" A precise
<i>Groatsworth</i> issue to which Nashe responds in proper <i>Groatsworth</i>
phrase, with echo as well from his Preface to the <i>Menaphon</i>, and
with a parting fling at Harvey.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> Then, as if to round out the company,
there enters Kind Hart, a-puffing,&mdash;Chettle, himself, the
conservator of the 'Colledge.' Thus Dekker the contemporary
of the <i>Groatsworth</i> group fixes the identity of its 'Juvenall' on
earth and under. And the 'comedie' was writ in 1591 or the first
half of 1592.</p>

<p>But it is not easy to determine its name. A plea might be made
for <i>Summer's Last Will and Testament</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> on certain counts of R.
W.'s diatribe in <i>Martine Marsixtus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> but I doubt whether it would
convince. Simpson thinks that the 'comedie' was not improbably
<i>A Knack to Know a Knave</i>, which had been acted as new, June 10,
1592. Fleay,<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> however, asserts that there is not the slightest
ground for this conjecture; and Grosart<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> is sure that "no one who
reads <i>A Knack</i> can possibly find in it one line from either Greene
or Nashe." I shall not undertake to prove that Mr. Simpson was
right: it must, however, be observed that the subject of <i>A Knack</i>
was not foreign to the genius of Nashe; that two of the characters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
 the satirical commentator and the Welshman, have their
counterparts in his <i>Summer's Last Will</i>; and that Greene had with
godly intent written up and published the whole truth about knaves
and 'coosnage' only within the past year and a half. As for the
plot, it may have no analogue in Nashe's works, but in one<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> at least
of its threads it parallels <i>Friar Bacon</i>, and in another<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> the
<i>Looking-Glasse</i>; and four or five of its situations<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> reproduce peculiarities
and language of those plays. As for the speeches, though
more than one is reminiscent of Greene's <i>rococo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> the style is more
like that of the <i>Last Will</i>. To be sure there are <i>septenarii</i> in the
<i>Knack</i>, and none in the <i>Will</i>; but the blank verse, such as it is,
might readily have been chipped from Nashe; so also the short
irregular rhymed lines, and much of the prose. The vocabulary
is not unlike his. Nashe might have been capable of the classical
excrescences; Greene certainly was not. These coincidences are,
of course, merely suggestive. For me they indicate possibly that if
Greene had no hand in the play, some one who lacked his touch and
most of his cunning has freely plundered him;<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> and that, if he had
an interest in the play, it was limited to the suggestion of plot and
treatment. Nashe may have thrown the material into shape. It is
a small matter, but perhaps worth recording, that the <i>Knack</i> calls
itself "a most pleasant and merie new <i>Comedie</i>," that Greene calls
the play "lastly writ" a 'comedie,' and that no other play connected
with his name save the doubtful <i>Pinner</i> is so described. Also
that the date of the <i>Knack</i> accords with the conditions: it was played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>about two months before the <i>Groatsworth</i> was begun, and by a company
that then was acting three dramas known to be Greene's.</p>

<p><b>Friar Bacon: Stage History and Materials</b>.&mdash;The position of
Greene's plays in the history of English comedy is indicated in
Professor Woodberry's article. The play here under discussion
was acted with some frequency between 1591 and 1594, sometimes
at important seasons, always with fair attendance, and occasionally
with large profits. It was performed at court as late as
1602, and was occasionally revived under James I. and Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>The necromantic theme with its instruments, the characters
primarily concerned (Bacon, Bungay, Vandermast, Miles), and the
catastrophes connected with the 'wonderfull glasse,' <i>i.e.</i> the materials
for Scenes ix., xi., xiii., are derived from <i>The Famous Historie of Frier
Bacon</i>, already mentioned&mdash;"a popular story-book probably written
toward the end of the sixteenth century, and founded upon accretions
of the legendary history of Roger Bacon."<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> The same source
afforded also the suggestion of Scenes ii. and vi.&mdash;the exposure
of Burden's intrigue and the interrupted wedding. The romantic
theme, its characters and incidents, and the enveloping action are
of Greene's devising. What slight resemblance the last bears to
history need not here be recapitulated. For that, and for the literary
career of the magical devices, the readers may consult the admirable
summaries of Ward<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> and Ritter, to which I have nothing to add
save that there exists a prior suggestion of the 'head of brass,' in
English drama, in the <i>Conflict of Conscience</i>, III. iii. 5, and, in the
same play, an instance of the 'crystal clear' or 'gladsome glass.'
The latter might seem, indeed, to be anticipated by the 'Glass of
Reson' in Redford's <i>Wyt and Science</i>, but that is a different thing.
The 'glass prospective' is adapted in <i>Friar Bacon</i> to a species of
stage business which is unique: the <i>scene beside a scene</i>,&mdash;a device
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>essentially distinct from the play within the play. While the persons
to whom we owe the disclosure of this parallel scene are no less surprised
thereby than are we, the persons of the scene disclosed not
only vitally affect the main action by the unaffected pursuit of their
own interests, but incidentally present the fact that is stranger than
fiction. To the double illusion of the play concocted within a play,
this impromptu enlistment of nature in the ranks of art adds the
illusion of unconscious drama. Moreover, in the glass prospective
scenes, the piquancy of the preternatural is surpassed by that of
the natural; the artless eclipses the artificial, and the result is an
artistic irony. And, after all, these scenes beside the scene are but
the dear device of eavesdropping purged of the keyhole and the sneak.
They are not the strategic contrivance of the inner play of the
<i>Spanish Tragedy</i> or <i>Hamlet</i>, nor a mere mechanism for diversion as
in <i>James IV.</i> and <i>Midsummer Night</i>, nor an episode as in <i>Love's
Labor</i>, nor a substitute for the initial movement like the play within
the <i>Old Wives' Tale</i>, but a something that combines qualities from
each. The parallel scene is at the same time its own <i>raison d'être</i>,
and a reflex of its principal which it multiplies and raises to a higher
power.</p>

<p>The <i>motif</i>&mdash;the wooing by proxy&mdash;is, of course, as ancient as
the Arthuriad, and as modern as Miles Standish; indeed, older and
younger yet. This appearance precedes, however, several other
dramatic instances, such as those of <i>Faire Em</i>, the <i>Knack</i>, and, I
believe, <i>1 Henry VI.</i> There are likewise to be found precursors of
Edward's renunciation, as in the <i>Campaspe</i>, and later instances, as in
the <i>Knack</i> and other plays. The apparently motiveless abandonment
of Peggy is, however, a novelty, and uniquely handled; a
capital instance of 'comic' irony, invested with solemnity, and
introduced with a wink.</p>

<p><b>Dramatic Construction.</b>&mdash;The pedant might find it easy to break
this plot upon a wheel; but the plot is none the less a dramatic
success. It may be that the climax is reached too soon; but the
scene is none the less effective for its suddenness and in its consequence.
The sham desertion exists merely because Greene
was put to it, after his climax, to string out the romantic interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
In itself it is an absurdity, but a delicious absurdity; and, unsympathetic
as we may be with the mediæval test of constancy, the event
somehow suffices,&mdash;perhaps because it unfolds phases of Margaret's
character which owe their witchery to their unlikelihood. It may
be said that the title thread is, for us, of secondary interest; but
such a judgment would by no means hold true of an Elizabethan
audience. That, indeed, would delight in the necromantic 'business,'
with its elements of sensation and amaze, its contribution
to 'humours,' and its intermittent influence upon plot. It may
be said that the intersection of the threads is not of necessity, but of
external agency; that the tragic minor motive is imported, and the
enveloping action thin. But why measure the beautiful by rule
of thumb? The quality here is <i>sui generis</i>, residing in scenes
rather than fable&mdash;scenes idyllic, spectacular, amusing, so ordered
that movement shall be continuous and interest unflagging. The
interest is not primarily of character or solution; it proceeds
from the pageant: and the continuity from the manager. Greene,
the story-teller, has suborned Greene, the <i>impresario</i>; there results
this panel-romance, a drama of the picturesque. On no previous
occasion had sentimental, comic, sensational, mysterious, sublime,
and tragic been so blended upon an English background for a comedy
of English life. This was something novel for the pit; a spectacle
kaleidoscopic, rapid, innocuous; a heart-in-the-mouth ecstasy, a
circus of many rings. How artistically it was contrived appears when
one considers the sequence and grouping of the scenes. These fall
into series, which happen to be five in number; but to indicate
them as acts in the text might impair the charade-like simplicity
of the show. The series are: <i>First</i>, Scenes i.-iv., four groups and
four environments, the material of all future combinations of scene
and sensation: the courtiers on the country side&mdash;chivalric and
idyllic; the doctors and the colleges&mdash;scholastic, necromantic; the
country folk and their fair&mdash;pastoral, romantic; the royal residence
and the court&mdash;spectacular; time, about two days. <i>Second</i>, Scenes
v.&mdash;vii., Oxford: street, cell, and regent-house&mdash;the riotous, magical,
romantic, and spectacular; apparently the day after Scene i., but
actually some two days. <i>Third</i>, Scenes viii.-x., the next day:
country, college, and country again&mdash;romance, black art, peril,
and pathos. <i>Fourth</i>, Scenes xi.-xiii., sixty days later; college, court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
and college&mdash;magic, majesty, and collapse of the supernatural.
<i>Fifth</i>, Scenes xiv.-xvi., the next day: country, college, and court&mdash;mock
heroics and the pastoral, burlesque of the supernatural, the
smile of royalty, and <i>couleur de rose</i>. Throughout, the action is
sustained, the crises are frequent, the reversals of fortune unexpected
and absorbing, the suspense sufficient.</p>

<p>In spite of the author's efforts to make a prig of Margaret,
and in spite of all disparity between her station and her style, the
"lovely star of Fressingfield" shines first and fairest of her daughters
in English comedy,&mdash;of country wenches born to conquer.
Innocent, coy, standing upon her "honest points," she is neither
unsophisticated nor crude&mdash;but a perilous coquette. In wit, yielding
not to the Lincoln earl, and in diplomacy one too many for the
prince, she hardly needs to warn them or us that she has had lords
for lovers before. "Stately in her stammell red," she toys with
Edward, for whom she doesn't care; but his deputy-lover she corners
at first chance, and it is then "marriage or no market" with this
maid. She outplays the irate Prince of Wales by sheer loyalty to
his rival: "'Twas I, not Lacy, stept awry;" and if her lover be to
fall, she will join him "in one tomb." When it comes to Lacy's
desertion of her, the dramatist fills her mouth with piety, but the girl
bubbles through. As between the convent and the court she vastly
prefers the latter, and her farewell to the world is eloquent of
gowns. In spite of the pother with which she welcomes "base
attire," her "flesh is frayle"; and when her lover, with "enchanting
face," comes riding back, and the "wedding-robes are in the
tailor's hands," it doesn't take Peggy long to decide between "God
or Lord Lacy." In simple dignity she is most like her Greenian
sisters, Ida and Angelica. But she is also the predecessor of many a
heroine not so simple as men have thought: of Alfrida in the <i>Knack</i>,
Bridget in <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, Harriet in the <i>Man of Mode</i>,
Dorinda in the <i>Beaux' Stratagem</i>, Lucinda in the <i>Conscious Lovers</i>.
As for her lover, his type is that of Alfrida's Ethenwald, more
manly to be sure than he, but lacking leagues of what a Lacy
should have been. Even the <i>Post</i> is at pains to apologize for him.
Still, Lacy excels his master&mdash;an ordinary Lothario of the purple,
noised abroad as generous, admired of his associates and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
dramatic creator, but of unregal stuff. In reality, Edward is less
magnanimous than his counterpart in Lyly's play. If he appears
more ready than Alexander was to yield his victim, it is only because
a keeper's daughter and a princess are "sisters under the skin."
The Castile Elinor awaits him: Edward is as moral as a jelly-fish;
and a swap of mistresses is no hardship. The characterization of
Warren and Ermsbie, though but a score of lines, is clear-cut.
Blunt Anglo-Saxons they are, prompt with the sword, with women
dubious&mdash;a complementary pair. Also complementary are the
fools&mdash;one of the court, the other of the home: Rafe the jester,
Miles the blunderer; the latter halfway between vice and clown.
Like the clown, he stimulates progress by the spur of his stupidity;
like the vice, he jogs without concern to his predestined place.
With Longtongue and Ragan he is of the kin of disputatious servants,
a brother to Greene's Jenkin, Adam, and Slipper, and, like
the last two, a "philosopher of toast and ale." Lentulo of the
<i>Rare Triumphs</i> was an ancient relative of his, and, like him, educated
in that school whence later proceeded the Dogberrys and
their cousins german&mdash;Poppev, Curtall, and Mouse. This is the
stock and discipline that Kemp's Gothamites bewray when their
tongues blossom into counsel.</p>

<p><b>Previous Editions and the Present Text.</b>&mdash;The first quarto is
White's, of 1594. The copy in the British Museum (C. 34, c. 37)
lacks all after 44 from the words, "for to pleasure" (xv. 49); that
in the Duke of Devonshire's library "lacks a leaf between A 3 and
B, and one at end" (Grosart). Dyce, Ward, and Grosart mention
a reprint of 1599; but I do not find it in B.M. or the Bodleian.
The quarto which Dr. Ward supposes to be of 1599 (viz. Malone,
226 in the Bodleian) is exactly like the 1630 quarto, except that it
lacks the title-page and is badly clipped. The attribution to 1599
seems to rest upon (1) Malone's Ms. note on the fly-leaf of 1630
quarto (Bodl. Malone, 227): "See the edit. of 1599 in Vol. 69,"
and (2) the hand-written date, 1599 (probably, also, by Malone) on
the upper right-hand corner of the first page of the quarto contained
in the volume 69, which is the Malone 226 mentioned above. But
that Malone 226 and 227 should be respectively of 1599 and 1630,
and, nevertheless, identical, would be odd: especially when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
remember that the copyright had been transferred from Mrs. White
to Mrs. Aldee in 1624, and that Mrs. Aldee's publication of 1630
was a fresh edition "as it was lately plaid by the Prince Palatine
his servants." I think that the supposed 1599 copy is of 1630.
The 1630 edition (another copy of which is in B. M.) varies considerably
from the original of 1594. The copyright passed into
Oulton's hands in 1640, and in 1655 a new edition appeared.
Modern issues are those of Dodsley, Dyce, Ward, and Grosart
(Do., Dy., W., G.), the last of which, alone, retains the original
forms, those of the Chatsworth, 1594. The present edition follows
the B.M. quarto of 1594, and, when that ends, Grosart's (Huth
Library) reprint of the Chatsworth. Variations in the 1630 quartos
(Malone) have been indicated in the footnotes. Q 1 stands for ed.
1594, Q 3 for 1630, Q 4 for 1655.</p>

<p>Since most of the emendations made by preceding editors plead as
their excuse the metrical irregularity of the quartos, I have found it
necessary to justify my retention of the original text, by an explanation
of Greene's metrical practice in this play. This <i>apologia</i>,
which, in some degree, applies to all of his plays, will be found in
the Appendix. We should, perhaps, be troubled with fewer emendations
of the Elizabethan drama if we could bring ourselves to
believe that playwrights regulated their rhythms more frequently
than is supposed, by dramatic and rhetorical conditions of utterance;
and that the plays of the sixteenth century were not written in the
eighteenth.</p>

specify. A comparative investigation satisfies me that only the following passages can be assigned
to Lodge: Sc. iii. (Dy., pp. 120-122; Gros., ll. 319-480) Usurer, Thrasyb., Alcon, as far
as <i>Enter Remilia</i>; Sc. v. (Dy., pp. 124-126; Gros., ll. 654-868) Alcon, Thr., Lawy.,
Judge, Usur., as far as <i>Enter Adam</i>; Sc. vii. (Dy., pp. 129, 130; Gros., ll. 1070-1169)
Jonas, Angel, Merchants, etc.; Sc. x. (Dy., pp. 134, 135; Gros., ll. 1512-1604), Merchants,
etc.; Sc. xiii. (Dy., pp. 138-139; Gros., ll. 1900-2020) Thr., Alcon, etc.&mdash;Sc. viii.
(Dy., p. 130; Gros., ll. 1180-1363) Alcon, etc., to <i>Exit Samia</i>, shows signs of Lodge principally,
but some of the lines are Greene's. In general, each of the prophetic interludes is by
the author of the scene preceding. <i>E.g.</i> ll. 1591-1653, Jonas, Angel, Oseas, by Lodge.
From l. 2020 all is by Greene; therefore most of Jonas.</p></div>

Marlowe in the attack upon Greene's unsuccessful heroic play, and that Lodge is satirized under
the (<i>Perymedes</i>) mention of the "mad preest," assigns the <i>L.-G.</i> to a later date. But we find
no evidence of coolness between Lodge and Greene during 1588 and 1589. On the contrary,
Lodge prefixes to the <i>Span. Masquer.</i> (<i>S. R.</i> February 1, 1589), verses calling Greene his <i>doux
ami</i> and <i>compagnon de Dieux</i>, and rejoices to be associated with his fame. The friendship was
still fresh when Greene died. Lodge was not the "mad preest." Nor can I adopt Mr. Fleay's
other conjecture (<i>Biog. Chron.</i> II. 31) that the "preest" was Hieronimo.</p></div>

1764. The passage, ll. 1764-1782, interrupts a scene otherwise sufficient to itself, with a
pageant of supernumeraries whose utterance is a veritable "fa-burden." The bit looks almost
like an afterthought, aping Marlowan style; but it is manifest Greene, not Lodge.</p></div>

'aldertruest,' <i>M. G.</i> (Descript. of Sheph. and Wife), 'alderliefest,' an archaism found
nowhere else in Greene,&mdash;but in the Folio of 2 <i>Henry VI.</i> l. 28 (prob. by Greene, Fleay,
<i>Shakespeare</i>, p. 269). The sentiment of Philador's <i>Scrowle and Ode</i> in <i>M. G.</i> is a variant
of the Ovidian precept of <i>James IV.</i> l. 1108.</p></div>

again revived," etc. "And yet <i>they</i> shame not to subscribe 'By a graduate in Cambridge' '<i>In

though Nashe had revived Will Somers in the <i>L. W. and T.</i>, though he was entitled to subscribe
himself "Graduate in C.," as Greene had done, and though Greene is the <i>A. M.</i> and
intended "Pharisee," etc., the "scurrilous prognostications" and the other earmarks are hard
to find in <i>L. W. and T.</i>, as we have it. The "lute-string" passage (Dods. IX. 22) recalls
Thrasybulus' remarks in <i>Lk.-Gl.</i> Sc. v.; but that scene is probably by Lodge, and Nashe
himself parallels the passage more closely in <i>Christ's Tears</i> (1593).</p></div>

I know hel is a hot place, and men are mervailous drie, and much
drinke is spent there; I would be a tapster.</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> Thou shalt.</p>

<p><i>Miles.</i> Theres nothing lets me from going with you, but that tis
a long journey, and I have never a horse.                             <span class="linenum">45</span></p>

APPENDIX </h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Some Alleged Irregularities in the Versification of Friar Bacon</span></p>

<p>If we take the first quarto of <i>Friar Bacon</i> as we find it, we shall see that
some of the peculiarities in verse structure are mannerisms with which every
student of contemporary drama is familiar, and that others may be justified as
intended for rhythmical and dramatic expressiveness. These considerations
convince me that it is best to leave the versification&mdash;and consequently most
of the text&mdash;as it was in 1594.</p>

<p><b><a id="A_Accent"></a>A. Accent.</b>&mdash;1. Greene makes frequent use of the <i>stress-syllable opening</i>.&mdash;Sometimes
for emphasis as in</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>ii. 49. Bów to the fórce of his pentágerón; and in vi. 28, 35, 45, 58. </p>
 </blockquote>

<p class="noin">Sometimes for the tripping effect, as in many of the lines assigned to Margaret,
<i>e.g.</i> iii. 10, 13, 15, 21, 30, 31; and in lines expressive of the blithe, or
the beautiful, such as i. 14, 15, 56, 60, 75, 81. Such stress-syllable openings
are frequently counterbalanced by an anapæstic second or third foot;
occasionally by two anapæsts, as in</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>vi. 58. Lácie, love mákes no excéption of a friend; </p>

 <p>xii. 56. Híe thee to Frésingfield and bring hóme the lásse. </p>
 </blockquote>

<p>2. The stress syllable is used also to open the verse-section after the
pause, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
 i. 78. She túrned her smócke | óver her lilly ármes; and in iii. 7.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">But 'over,' 'safely,' might be read with the hovering accent. So xvi. 21
('prìncès'). Methods (1) and (2) appear to be combined in</p>

<blockquote><p>
iii. 79. Máke but a stép | ínto the keépers lódge; and in iii. 81, iv. 5,
vi. 138.
</p></blockquote>

<p>3. The extra syllable is adroitly used before the verse-section (the <i>epic
cæsura</i>) as a compensation for the stress-syllable opening:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
ii. 156. Maíster Búrd<i>en</i> | whèn shàll we sée you at Hénley?</p>
<p>
xiv. 47. (Pégg<i>ie</i> | thy daúghter, etc.), and vi. 58 as above (Lác<i>ie</i> | lòve
màkes).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>

4. The <i>hovering accent</i> is evident in such lines as</p>

<blockquote><p>
viii. 149. I práy | Gòd Ì | like hèr | as I lóv|ed theé.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">It emphasizes the reluctant utterance. Ignoring this, Dy. and G. change
text and rhythm to:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
'Pray Gód | I like | her ás | I lóv|ed thee.
</p></blockquote>

<p><b><a id="B_Quantity"></a>B. Quantity.</b>&mdash;1. A syllable is broken into a dissyllable, or prolonged
by way of emphasis, in such cases as i. 168 (your̈ heart's), ii. 18 (of āll
⋀ this), ii. 170 (Ā-men), ix. 116 (haile, or hāile), vi. 17, xii. 43 (fair̈e),
xiii. 38 (hour̈e). In names like Marg(a)ret, Erm(e)sbie, diæresis or dialysis
often occurs. For Elizabethan usage, see Schipper, <i>Neuengl. Metrik</i>, 1:
§ 53, and Knaut, <i>Metrik R. Greene's</i> (Halle, 1890).</p>

<p>2. In vi. 4, 171, vii. 25, etc., such words as <i>devil</i>, <i>spirit</i>, are contracted
by synæresis or slurring. In x. 55, xiii. 3, xiii. 38 (while I've;
he'd; thou'st), we find elision or apocope, as, also, in xiv. 79, vi. 162,
xiii. 37 ('n if she bé; 'n if your hónour; there'll bé). In <i>vig'r, El'nor,
fri'r, pow'r, fi'ry</i>, syncope. In vi. 135, ix 129 (To⌒avoid; no⌒unlesse),
synalœpha. Evidently the dramatist has in mind the spoken sentence, in
which slurring and rapid pronunciation are more likely to occur than omission
of syllables.</p>

<p><b><a id="C_Lacking_Syllables"></a>C. Lacking Syllables.</b>&mdash;1. <i>Compensation for one syllable</i> is made by a
rhetorical pause, or by lengthening or emphasizing the next syllable, <i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the first foot, for an absent thesis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 17.  ⋀ Thát this fai-r coúrteous coúntrie swaíne;</p>

<p>
vi. 130. ⋀ Made me thinke the shádows súbstàncès;
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">unless we read with hovering accent, <i>sc.</i> "Màde mè ⋀ thínke," which
wouýld accumulate the emphasis upon 'thinke.' Do., Dy., W., gratuitously
insert 'to' before 'thinke.'</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 161. ⋀ Whý stànds frìer Búngay só amázed?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Another acephalous line. The suppression of the light syllable accentuates
the arsis 'Why.' For similar suppression in questions see i. 20, ii. 156.</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiv. 77. ⋀ Whý,&mdash;then Màrgret wíll be shórne a nún?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Accumulated emphasis of surprise. So, in iii. 4: (⋀ Thómas, maids
when they cóme), etc.; and in</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiv. 34. ⋀ Lóve ... oh, Lóve!&mdash;and wíth fond Lóve, farewéll.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Dy., G., W., "Farewell, oh Love" for first two feet. But why should
Margaret repeat a verb which she has used twice already in this speech? As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Greene, he was not writing a primer of prosody for school recitations. Margaret
has said farewell to world, friends, father, and dainty robes, then with a sigh or
sob, for which Greene allows by the lacuna, she bids adieu to the dearest&mdash;"⋀
Lóve ... oh Lóve." The pause before <i>Love</i> heightens the explosion.
A similar effect is produced by the suppression at the beginning of</p>

<table summary="suppression">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>xiv. 20.</td>
<td class="br">⋀ Pride,</td>
 <td class="br">flàttèr iè ànd</td>
 <td>incónstant thoúghts</td></tr>
<tr><td>or perhaps</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="br">⋀ Príde</td>
 <td>⋀ flát terie ánd.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noin">Dy. says this line is mutilated, and G. inserts 'vanitie' after 'Pride.' But
the line is all right. See also <i>C</i>, 2 <i>b</i>, below.</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix. 171. ⋀ Grátious ás the mórning stárre of heáven.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">I prefer this to Ward's emendation (approved by Wagner) 'Gratious as
<i>is</i>,' because the Q is less sibilant and, owing to the pause, more deliberate
and forcible. Greene may have written 'As gracious'; for compare <i>Looking-Glasse</i>,
l. 14, 'As glorious,' etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix. 257.  ⋀ Pérsia, dówne <i>her</i> Vòlga bý canóws.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The rhetorical emphasis on 'her' compensates (with the hovering accent) for
the aposiopesis before 'Persia.' Greene's metrical effects don't always count
upon the fingers, but they are often rhythmically delightful.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) For a lacking thesis in the second foot, a similar rhetorical pause,
sometimes also an anapæstic third foot, may compensate, as in</p>

<blockquote><p>
i. 11. And nów ⋀ chángde to a mélanchólie dúmpe.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The 'a' is in Q 1. Wagner's emendation (<i>Anglia</i>, p. 523; 1879),
"<i>he's</i> chang'd to melancholy dump," is futile.</p>

<blockquote><p>
ii. 62. Carved oút ⋀ like to the pórtall óf the súnne.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Pause for reflection. The ear is satisfied by the spondaic first foot and the
anapæstic third. (With i. 11 and ii. 62 cf. <i>A</i> 2 above.)</p>

<blockquote><p>
vii. 3. For hé ⋀ troópt with áll the wésterne kíngs.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The rhythmical aposiopesis represents a rhetorical pause for which the
strongly accented 'troopt' and 'all' compensate. Do., Dy., G., W., read
'troopèd,'&mdash;but I don't think Greene did.</p>

<blockquote><p>
x. 27. Contént ⋀ keéper; sénd her únto ús.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">I have inserted a dash for the pause of decision after 'content': Lambert
accepts the proposition and acts. No metrical stop-gap is necessary.</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>

Sometimes the arsis is lacking, and is supplied by a pause or gesture:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiii. 4. Ah, Búngay, ⊼ my Brazen-head is spoíled.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">A second 'ah' suggests itself, and Dy. and W. print it. But I have no
doubt Greene intended the speaker to draw breath for a sigh indicative of
despair.</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiv. 111. Come, Sússex, ⊼ let's ín we sháll have móre.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The missing arsis is supplied by the pause that succeeds a command. With
different punctuation we have '⋀ Cóme! | Sússex, let's ín,' which is as
good. The editors keep Lacie talking.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) In the third foot, lacking thesis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix. 229. And gíve us cátes ⋀ fit for coúntrey swáines.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">If the emperor did not pause for language suitable to the emergency, it was
because he pronounced 'cates' as a dissyllable. Cf. Marlowe's <i>Faustus</i>
(Dyce ed. 1850, p. 211), "Pardon me <i>sweet</i>, ⋀ Í forgot myself."</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix. 144. How nów, ⋀ Vándermást! have you mét with your mátch?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Pause for surprise. If the pause should fall before 'have' it would indicate
the transition to inquiry. In this and the next instance anapæstic compensation
is prominent.</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix.  148. Why Vándermast, ⋀ árt thou óvercóme?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">But it is rhetorically more natural to read: '⋀ Whý ⋀ Vándermást, art thou
óvercóme?'</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In the fourth foot, lacking thesis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
v. 62-64. <i>Edw.</i> To whóm speakest thóu? <i>Bacon.</i> To thée. <i>Edw.</i>
⋀ Whó art thóu?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noin">Pause justified by change of speaker, and the indignant inquiry.</p>

<p>2. <i>Two or more syllables lacking.</i> To assume that omissions of this
kind are due to carelessness on the part of author, scribe, or printer, is to beg
the question. It is more reasonable to premise the genuineness of the lines
and consider whether each in turn is not to be justified by its dramatic conditions.
The following sixteen exhaust, I think, the more flagrant instances
of lacuna in this play. In none would I alter the text of the first quarto.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Edward's lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 47. Gogs wóunds ⋀ Bácon hére comes Lácie ⊼.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Abrupt outcry, in which the less and the more forcible exclamatory pauses
are metrically provided for by the lacking thesis and arsis respectively. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
lacking thesis allows also for the transition from surprise to affirmation. This
line is paralleled by</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 127. Gogs wóunds ⋀ Bácon they kísse! Ile stáb them ⊼.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The former pause for breathless amazement; the latter for decision and a
gesture. He raises his hand to deal the blow.</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 146. Helpe, Bácon ⊼! ⋀ stóp the márriage nów!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Dyce, "some word or words wanting." Others would supply "Helpe!
and" and so reduce the line to mediocrity. The omission is intentional.
The exclamatory pause after 'Bacon' is metrically equivalent to an accented
syllable. The pause before 'stop' is for Edward's quandary&mdash;as if he
should for a moment cast about for an appropriate request. The line might
of course be interpreted so as to require one lacking thesis before 'Helpe' and
one before 'Bacon.'</p>

<blockquote><p>
vi. 108. ⋀ Hów familiar they bé, Bacòn, ⋀ ⊼.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">First pause, the gasp before an interrogatory exclamation. Second pause
for Bacon's 'Sit still,' which as a convertible fo<i>o</i>t is the last of this line and
the first of the next.</p>

<p>
vi. 176. The foot pause before 'Flees' may allow for a burst of
laughter. Wagner suggests '<i>very</i> fear,' which no compatriot of Greene,
if he read the line aloud, can tolerate. Until English is a dead
language it will hardly be judicious to encourage foreign emendations
of our masterpieces.
</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Margaret's lines.</p>

<p>
iii. 46. Suppression of the first two feet in rapid dialogue. The
words 'sent this rich purse' might have been set down before 'To me?'
but with what advantage save to fill the pentameter? For the clause
has occurred once and the verb twice already in the last six lines.
The suppression intensifies the dialogue, and accentuates the mingled
surprise and impatience of the speaker.</p>

<p>viii. 132. A rhetorical pause occupies the first foot or the last. Like
the preceding instance in so far as the aposiopesis indicates question
and surprise. Dy., G., insert 'indeed' before 'mean': easy but needless.</p>

<p>x. 156. Dy. queries 'shall be' after 'wealth.' But the words 'shall be'
are implied from the preceding line, and so intentionally omitted. An
additional rhetorical emphasis falls upon <i>trash</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">Wealth, ⊼ ⋀ träsh; love, háte; pleàsùre, dispaíre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>xiv. 20. Impassioned soliloquy within an address, like x. 158. The
light syllables of the first and second feet are suppressed to increase
the effect of the accented syllables: ⋀ Príde ⋀ flätterie and&mdash;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
(<i>c</i>) Lines of other characters.</p>

<p>ii. 157. The infuriate Burden occupies the first foot with a stifled
'Henly!' or something unreverend.</p>

<p>ix. 120. An interrogatory pause for the first foot or an exclamatory
for the last; unless we combine the lines thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Van.</i> What art thóu that quéstionst thús? <i>Bacon.</i> Men cáll me Bácon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ix. 162. Whý, ⋀ Bacon, whíther dost thóu send him.
</p>

<p class="noin">As in vi. 161, and ix. 148, the lacunæ correspond with moments of
breathless surprise; and emphasis is accumulated upon the syllables respectively
succeeding. If we scan without pauses, the lacunæ will occupy the
fifth foot which might naturally be reserved for Bacon's echo-question [send
him?]. 'Whither,' probably contracted 'whe'r.'</p>

<blockquote><p>
x. 150. What ánswere shall Í retúrne to my lórd? [<i>Marg</i>. Retúrne?]
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Another echo-foot. Unless we pronounce 'réturne' for which there is
authority, as in iv. 56, 'prógress,' ix. 242, 'éxceed.' See Schipper,
<i>Neuengl. Metr.</i>, p. 153.</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiii. 72. My father slaine! ⋀⊼ Sèrlbỳ, ward thát.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">The thesis of the third foot allows for the recoil of horror; the arsis for
the transition to revenge&mdash;the drawing of the rapier.</p>

<p>
xiv. 99. Echo of the previous idea, unuttered because dramatically understood;
[<span class="combination">
<span class="above">'<i>As</i></span>
<span class="below">⋀</span></span>
 <span class="combination">
<span class="above"><i>glád</i></span>
<span class="below">⊼</span></span>] as if,' etc. Dy. suggests insertion 'As <i>glad as</i> if,' and
G. adopts. No.</p>
<blockquote><p>
xvi. 69. Let's márch: ⋀ ⩡ the tábles áll are spréad.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The silent foot allows for the rhetorical pause between command and
affirmation. Cf. vi. 146. Dy.'s 'Let <i>us</i> march <i>hence</i>,' and G.'s 'Let <i>us</i>
march <i>on</i>,' will do well enough if we must keep somebody talking all the
time.</p>

<p><b><a id="D_Additional_Syllables"></a>D. Additional Syllables.</b>&mdash;Like the foregoing apparently deficient lines
it will be found that, properly read, most of the so-called hypermetric lines
conform to the pentameter. The dozen or so that do not are warranted
by historic, if not by rhetorical, conditions. At any rate they are much
more likely to be the lines that Greene wrote than are the 'procrustitutes'
which we might suggest.</p>

<p>1. Readers should allow for <i>feminine endings</i>, as</p>

<blockquote><p>
ix. 111. To thém of Síen, Flórence ánd Belógna;
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">or <i>Bolónia</i>, gliding ending.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>

ii. 156. ⋀ Maíster Búrden whèn shàll we sée you at Hénly?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">Of feminine endings Knaut counts ten, and about four gliding.</p>

<p>2. They should allow also for the anapæst in itself (as ix. 231) or by way
of compensation for a missing syllable in an adjoining foot. Two such give
the appearance of a senarius. Occasionally, as in vi. 163 ('gay straightwáy,'
or 'way from Frés&mdash;'), the foot is awkward. Even so, I do not think that
the emendation 'straight' (Dy., W.) for this 'straightway' is necessary.</p>

<p>3. <i>Senarii.</i> (<i>a</i>) The following are such in appearance only. They
should be read as pentameters in which the anapæst, slurring, or elision, is
employed. In</p>

<blockquote><p>
i. 156. Send létters speéd'ly | to Óxford óf the néwes,
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">we have the epic cæsura. So also vi. 94, cæsura after 'Beckles'; and so</p>

<blockquote><p>
x. 77. Give mè ... but tén days' réspite | and Íle replý,</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>xvi. 30. Atténds on Él'nor | gramércies, lórd, for hér.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In ix. 191. ⋀ Mártiall Plantágenet | Hénries highmínded sónne,

we have the lyric cæsura; so also in</p>

<blockquote><p>
xiii. 67. Then this for her | Áh, well thrúst. But márke, the wárd.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Cf. Schipper <i>Neuengl. Metr.</i>, p. 25 <i>n</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In iii. 51. For we've líttle leísure tó debáte of thát,</p>

<p>
vi. 131-132. 'Twere a lóng poinárd, my lórd, to reách betweéne
⋀ Óxford and Frésingfiéld, but sit stíll and see móre,</p>

<p>vi. 162. I've stroók him dúm my lórd | 'n if your hónor pleáse,</p>

<p>ix. 31. Of éleméntal éssence, térra's but thóught,</p>

<p>ix. 45. Ànd òf the víg'r of the géomantic fiends,</p>

<p>
xiv. 79. We cánnot stáy my lórd | 'n if she bé so stríct,&mdash;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noin">anapaestic readings with natural apocope or syncope preserve the pentameter.
Dy's 'you' for 'your honor' in vi. 162, and omission of 'my lord' in
xiv. 79, are therefore unnecessary.</p>

<p>xvi. 64 appears to have six feet; but if it is taken in sequence with the
preceding line the effect is of two five-foot lines.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The following senarii of Q 1 are real, and should be preserved, though
Dyce and Ward generally place the first foot in a line by itself. The Marlowan
reform had not yet completed the rout of the Alexandrine,&mdash;and
even if it had Greene would have remained unrouted. He uses the Alexandrine,
sometimes unconsciously, sometimes for variety. Perhaps a few of
these senarii, i. 10, 83; ii. 112, 148; iii. 26; vi. 77; ix. 185; x. 149;
xi. 7, 92; xii. 18; xiv. 78; xvi. 40, are accidental, but most of them are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
intended to be impressive, and the additional foot generally indicates the
person most concerned.</p>

<p><b><a id="E_Other_Debated_Lines"></a>E. Other Debated Lines.</b></p>

<p>
iv. 11. Ward retains the senarius. Dyce thinks 'corrupted,' and
queries, 'As Agenor's damsel did,' for 'through the deep' is almost a
repetition of 'through the seas.'&mdash;Wagner: 'like Europa through the
deep.'&mdash;Perhaps (says Palgrave acc. to Ward) the dramatist pronounced
the name <i>Ágenor</i>. We might then scan:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>

And vénture as Ágenor's dámsel thróugh the deép.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">But it is quite as likely that Greene intended, or let slip, a senarius.
ix. 112. The quartos are right, and we should scan thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
Reìmès, Lovaín, and faí-r Rótherdam.
</p></blockquote>

<p>For 'fayer,' etc., see <i>B</i> 1, above. By altering to 'Rheims,' Do., Dy.,
G., and W. miss the metre. G., for instance, reads 'Rheims [and]'; Elze
(<i>Notes on Elizab. Dramatists</i>, Halle, 1886, cxcix): 'Of Rheíms, of Loúvain
ánd fair Rótterdám'; Knaut: 'Rheims, Loúvain, Páris ánd.' But if we
preserve the spelling of the quartos the scansion is simple.</p>

<p><b>A Few Conclusions.</b>&mdash;Greene was sensitive to dramatic niceties of utterance.
Hence most of the metrical idiosyncrasies which are improperly
called irregularities. An induction from the instances cited under <i>C</i> above shows
that the following were the conditions of utterance to which he accorded special
elocutionary recognition: the pause before a question or a response and the
increase of emphasis upon the syllable succeeding the silence; the pause for
reflection, and the pause before deliberate utterance; decision attending a command;
the pause of speechless anger; the stoppage due to sighing, sobbing,
horror, or any recoil of emotion; the period of, or after, a gesture, an inarticulate
cry, a burst of laughter, an exclamatory remark; the pause during the
suppression of the self-explanatory. The examination of his practice in
<i>Friar Bacon</i> shows that in order to represent these conditions in dramatic
blank verse Greene availed himself of silent beats with a uniformity that might
be called system, were it the outcome of anything less spontaneous than the
rhetorical instinct and the feeling for rhythm. Subordinating these to his
knowledge of stage 'business,' Greene seems, then, to have developed a metrical
use of the lacuna somewhat like this:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Before</i> an important affirmation, the name of one addressed in exclamation,
an inquiry, an imperative request, a command;</li>

<li><i>At</i> the transition from one form of utterance to another, the suppression of
word or words understood, the gulp of rage, the burst of laughter;</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>

<i>After</i> an outcry.</li></ul>

<p>These conclusions are confirmed by an examination of the other plays in
which the text is fairly authentic. The dramatist naturally and, in that sense,
intentionally suited his 'lines' to the histrionic emergency: an achievement
not difficult for one of his rhetorical quality, who was also familiar with the
practice of the stage. On similar grounds and with a regard likewise for the
conditions of verse at the time, his senarii are to be retained and defended.</p>

<p>Most of the attempts to reduce his dramatic blank verse to anything like
measured uniformity are, therefore, in my opinion academic and superfluous.
They are indeed worse, for not only do they ignore the personal equation,
they tend to pervert the data from which the history of English metres must
be derived. There may, of course, be lines, like vi. 17 and ix. 47 of this
play, where dramatist or intermediary has unwittingly omitted something, or
actor wantonly added, but they are few; and unless the sense calls out for
orthopædic assistance, no literary, historical, or philological interest is subserved
by doctoring the text.</p>

CRITICAL ESSAY </h3>

<p><b>The Facts of Porter's Life.</b>&mdash;<i>The Two Angry Women of Abington</i> is
the only extant production of Henry Porter. In 1841 Mr. Collier, who was
then editing Henslowe's <i>Diary</i>, supplied Mr. Dyce with what purported to
be all the materials in that journal relative to this dramatist; and these, with
the exception of one of August 23, 1597, connecting him with Nashe, which
has been shown to be a forgery, are copied from Dyce's Percy Society edition
of the <i>Two Angrie Women</i> by Mr. H. Ellis for the preface to the Mermaid
edition of the play. The statement is there made that "the foregoing extracts&mdash;extending
over the brief period of a single year ... contain all the definite
information which has reached us concerning Henry Porter." An examination
of Collier's Henslowe's <i>Diary</i> will show, however, that Mr. Ellis omits
about a dozen entries<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> affecting our poet which, though inaccessible to Dyce
in 1841, have been available since 1845. A complete list of such notices
in their chronological order has not been set before the public. I, therefore,
subjoin the following, inserting an additional memorandum (No. 8) of January
17, 1598-9, from another source, and eliminating the suspicious Henslowe
entries which Mr. George F. Warner<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> has branded as Collier forgeries.
The references are to the first volume of the <i>Diary</i>.</p>

<p><b>Other Early Notices.</b>&mdash;Meres, in the <i>Palladis Tamia</i>, 1598, names
our dramatist as one of the best for comedy among us, and places him in
good company: Lyly, Lodge, Gascoigne, Greene, Shakespeare, Nashe,
Thomas Heywood, Munday, Chapman, Wilson, Hathaway, and Chettle.
It is perhaps worthy of remark that, beginning with Nashe, all these playwrights
were at the time Porter's associates in the employ of Henslowe and the
Admiral's company, and that in this list our poet rubs shoulders with Chapman
and Wilson. Much less flattering are the references in Richard West's
<i>Court of Conscience or Dick Whipper's Sessions</i>, 1607,<a name="FNanchor_1587_1587" id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a> to "ruffianly Dick
Coomes" (Poem to <i>Prophane Swearers</i>) and "Nimble-tongued Nicholas
as the Proverbe saith" (Address to <i>Liers</i>), which are undoubtedly allusions
to our play<a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>: for although Porter's Nicholas is not a liar, his Coomes is,
in the extreme, ruffianly and profane. The context of <i>The Court of Conscience</i>
would indicate, however, that West was availing himself, to some
extent, of nicknames proverbial among the vulgar, such as Suckblood, Tom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
Taylor, Money Monger, and Nicholas Newfangle. That Porter's play was
still in circulation as late as 1661 is shown by its inclusion in Kirkman's
Catalogue of that date.</p>

<p><b>Conjectural Identity.</b>&mdash;Malone, Collier, and Dyce give no clue; in fact
they do not exhaust the materials in Henslowe. Langbaine mentions only
the printed play. Hunter, in his <i>Chorus Vatum Anglicanorum</i><a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> says "it
can hardly be doubted that this is the same Henry Porter of Christ Church
who was made Bachelor of Music in July, 1600 (<i>Alumn. Oxon.</i> III. 1182).
Wood says that he had seen some of his compositions, but thinks none were
extant when he wrote. This Henry Porter was father of Walter Porter,
Master of the Choristers at Westminster, who had friends in Sir Edward
Spencer and Edward Laurence. He was related to Dr. John Wilson."
Foster in the <i>Alumni Oxonienses</i>, tells us, in addition, that Walter became
gentleman of the Chapel Royal of Charles I. This information is all traceable
to Wood's <i>Fasti</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a> but Wood does not attempt to identify Henry Porter
the dramatist with Henry Porter the musical composer. Of the latter we
learn, from the <i>Register of the University of Oxford</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a> that he had studied
music for twelve years and had "composed" before he took his degree,
July 4, 1600. There is no record of a degree in arts, nor of matriculation,
at Christ Church; this musical activity would seem, however, to have
occupied the career of the future bachelor of music from a date eight years
before Porter the dramatist appeared in Henslowe's employ to a date after
our poet had borrowed his last half-crown from that employer. "The
statutable conditions for the degree of Mus. Bac." at that time, say Boase
and Clark,<a name="FNanchor_1592_1592" id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> "were that the candidate should have been seven years <i>in re
musica</i>, and that he should compose and cause to be sung in the university
a <i>canticum quinque partium</i>, giving three days' notice of the performance of
this exercise." That a student like Porter of Christ Church, who had
proceeded leisurely through his course in music, taking twelve years instead
of the seven prescribed, and who, meanwhile, was composing canticles on
elevated and, probably, sacred themes, should be a man of maturity and
acknowledged worth is only natural to suppose. And such was the esteem
in which Porter of Christ Church was held by an Oxford undergraduate
of that day, who addresses him in the following verses, published in
1599:<a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>

 "AD HENRICUM PORTER</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Porter I durst not mell with sacred writ,</div>
<div class="i0">Nor woe the mistris fore I win the maide;</div>

<div class="i2">Thy silver bell could not so sweetly sing</div>
<div class="i2">If that too soone thou hadst begun her ring."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">The Porter thus apostrophized by John Weever has set sacred writ to music,
but only after careful discipline leading to the musical art; and his wisdom
has been proved by the result: "Thy silver bell" of music, says his admirer,
"could not so sweetly sing, If that too soon thou hadst begun her ring."
Mr. Havelock Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a> to whom these verses were communicated by Mr.
Bullen, understands them to refer to Porter the dramatist, and concludes
therefrom, that he was "at the period of his <i>dramatic activity</i> a man of
mature age."</p>

<p>But there is nothing in Weever's verses applicable to the dramatist as we
know that personage: his extant play is anything but sacred, it presents no
particular evidence of mature authorship, betrays no interest in musical affairs,
yields no bell-tones of style or verse. While Weever was writing his
<i>Epigrams</i>, 1596 to 1599, the dramatist was pursuing anything but a staid
and silvern course at the Rose Theatre on the Bankside. The slowly matured
composer of canticles, on the other hand, was completing a leisurely discipline
at Christ Church, and to such a student Weever's eulogy admirably applies.<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>
In all probability the composer stuck to his <i>metier</i>. He was of a musical
family: his son obtained recognition from Court for his musical attainments;
and a kinsman, Dr. John Wilson, "a very eminent musician of whom there
is a long notice in Wood," was professor of music at Oxford in 1656.<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a></p>

<p>The familiarity with Oxford and its surroundings displayed in the drama
of the two angry women who meet in the neighboring village of Abington is,
however, indicative of Oxonian authorship, and we are again driven to the
registers of the university in search of some available Henry Porter. There
is, I find, but one capable, in point of chronology, of fulfilling the conditions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Matriculations: 19 June, 1589, Brazenose, Porter, Henry;
Lond., <i>gen. f.</i> 16."<a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>

 Concerning the academic career of this Henry Porter there is no information
to be gathered from the records of university or college&mdash;why he was
not admitted B.A., or why or when he left his college. I am apprised,
however, by Mr. C. B. Heberden, the Principal of Brasenose, who at my
request kindly instituted the requisite search, that such absence of information
is not unusual, for the College Register was very imperfectly kept in the
sixteenth century. If this was our Henry Porter, the author of the <i>Pleasant
History of the Two Angry Women</i>, he was born in 1573, the son of a gentleman
of London, he kept an uneventful term or so at Brasenose, and was
perhaps still there in 1592 when his future associate in Henslowe's employ,
John Marston, was matriculated. After his return to London he must have
taken speedily to play-writing, for he was not more than twenty-three years
of age when we find him selling his dramas to the Admiral's company for
distinctly reputable sums. A modest straw in favour of the supposition that
this was our dramatist is the explicit statement in both editions of our play
to the effect that its author was Henry Porter, <i>Gent</i>. We have no proof
that the Porter of Christ Church, who took his only degree after our play was
printed, had any right in 1599 to sign himself Gentleman.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Dramatic Career.</b>&mdash;Although, as I have said, only one of Porter's
plays is extant, the entries in Henslowe, and their context, enable us
to form some conception of his relation to the contemporary drama.
They indicate that between December 16, 1596, and May 26, 1599,
he was associated as a writer of plays with the Admiral, the Earl of
Nottingham's company of actors, and that after February 28, 1599,
his services were pledged to that company alone. It is possible that
he had also acquaintance among the Earl of Pembroke's men, who
were acting at The Rose for a short time during October and November,
1597, in partnership with the Admiral's company; but of
this we cannot be certain, for we have no record of Porter's actions
between March 7, 1597, and May 30 of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>The payment of December 16, 1596, is not in loan nor "in
earnest of a boocke," but <i>delivered</i> as for a play then completed;
and the sum, even if it were not a final instalment, would in itself
indicate a play of some promise, for £6 or £7 was as much as
Henslowe usually gave for a production even by an author already
distinguished. If the payment was for a completed "boocke," the
play would, according to the procedure of the Admiral's men, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
been ready for presentation within a period of ten days to six weeks
after the date of purchase. The following were the new plays presented
by this company during that period: <i>That Will Be Shall Be</i>,
December 30, 1596; <i>Alexander and Lodowick</i>, January 14, and
<i>Woman Hard to Please</i>, January 27, 1597. Of these <i>Alexander</i> was
the most successful, and <i>That Will Be</i> next.<a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> It is possible that
the third play was the work of Heywood who had been recently
paid 30s.&mdash;for a "boocke."<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> As to <i>Alexander</i>, it is mentioned two
years later as the property of Martin Slater,<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> and there is reason to
conjecture that it was written by him. But, even if these attributions
were conclusive, we should not <span class="err" title="original: he">be</span> justified in assuming&mdash;that
the book remaining unassigned, <i>That Will Be Shall Be</i>, was the
property for which Porter was paid on December 16, 1596. It is
not, however, impossible that his first production was one of the
three most popular plays put upon the boards at The Rose that
season. That Henslowe's loan to Porter on the following March 7
had any connection with a play of December 16, 1596, is most
unlikely. Henslowe was not by way of disbursing £9 for one
"boocke." The date is also too remote from May 30, 1598, to
permit of our connecting this loan with the payment for <i>Love Prevented</i>,
there mentioned, let alone the objection that if the entries
of March 7, 1597, and May 30, 1598, refer to the same play, the
author was paid the unusually high sum of £8. But though we
cannot prove that Porter made much out of Henslowe and the
Admiral's men, it would seem that they made a good deal out of
him. For after certain purchases from Porter and during the period
within which the first performances of his plays must naturally have
occurred, the theatre receipts increased appreciably. The play of
May 30, 1598, for instance, would, according to custom, have been
presented some time between June 10 and June 30. The only
other new play that could during those weeks have assisted to swell
the profits of the theatre was the First Part of <i>Blacke Battman of
the North</i>, by distinguished authors, to be sure, but not extant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>Henslowe's weekly receipts from "my Lord Admerall's mean"
during the month before June 10 had averaged £3 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; during
the period between June 10 and June 30 they rose to an average
of £5 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; the week after June 30 they fell again to
£2 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a> That Porter was at that time held in respect by
Henslowe is shown by the transaction of June 26, when the crafty
manager took his surety for the performance of a literary and pecuniary
obligation by Chettle, than whom no one could have been
habitually more in arrears. And that Porter's plays were worth
having is proved by Henslowe's engaging, in February of the next
year, everything that he might write, whether in partnership or
alone. That this appreciation of his plays was shared also by the
company appears from the unusual sums which they expended for
the apparel and properties necessary to their presentation.<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a></p>

<p>Of the playwrights at that time attached to the Admiral's company,
the most intimately associated with Porter would appear to
have been Chettle; and, through him, our poet must have been
brought into close relations with Robert Wilson, who was Chettle's
colleague in that <i>Second Part of Blacke Battman</i>, for the completion
of which Porter went surety,&mdash;also with Dekker and Drayton,
who had assisted in the writing of the First Part, and were, maybe,
interested in the Second. In fact, Chettle, Dekker, Drayton, Wilson
were boon companions in productivity and the 'marshallsey':
to go bail for one of them was presumably to pay for all. With
Ben Jonson, who was just then coming into notice as a dramatist,
Henry Porter must have drained many a flagon. In August, 1598,
these two have just finished writing a play in company with Chettle,
<i>Hot Anger Soon Cold</i>, and are paid a fair price for it by Henslowe,
who seems to regard Porter, however, as the principal author, for he
enters his name first in the record. But if the returns from this
play are included in Henslowe's receipts of the next two months,
it cannot have been more than an ordinarily successful production.<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a></p>

<p>During the latter part of 1598 our dramatist is engaged upon a
play called by Henslowe the <i>2 Pte of the 2 angrey women of abengton</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>This was rehearsed during January and February, 1599, and by
February 12, the day on which final payment was made to Porter,
£11<a name="FNanchor_1604_1604" id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> had been expended on properties for the performance. It
was probably ready for presentation at that time, and its success
may have assisted the sudden leap in Henslowe's share of the receipts
from £7 10<i>s.</i>, for the week ending February 18, to £15 3<i>s.</i>, for
the ten days ending February 29,<a name="FNanchor_1605_1605" id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> 1599. This play paid Porter £7,
a higher figure than <i>Hot Anger</i> had brought. Some two weeks later he
is under contract to produce a sequel, the <i>ij mery wemen of abenton</i>, and
only four days later still, March 11, he is engaged in a new partnership
with Chettle to produce a play entitled <i>The Spencers</i>, or <i>Despencers</i>,
a magnificent and tragic subject perhaps suggested by the reprinting
of Marlowe's <i>Edward II.</i> during the preceding year.<a name="FNanchor_1606_1606" id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> <i>The Spencers</i>
was finished by the 22d of the same month. That it was looked
upon as a play of great promise appears from the large amounts
which, as already stated, were expended in its preparation for the
stage. It was first acted some time after April 14. On the 16th
Henslowe enters a final small disbursement for properties, of which
perhaps the need was perceived during the first performance. His
receipts for the week ending April 15 rise to £13 7<i>s.</i>, four times
as much as for the week before; while the entry, £13 16<i>s.</i>, for the
week next ensuing, during which the play was surely on the stage,
is, with the exception of those of February 29, already mentioned,
and of June 3,<a name="FNanchor_1607_1607" id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> the largest that year. Perhaps by April 22 the
novelty of <i>The Spencers</i> had begun to wear off, for there is again a
drop in Henslowe's receipts, to £11 5<i>s.</i>, the week ending April 29.<a name="FNanchor_1608_1608" id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a>
This partnership with Chettle existed, by the way, in the year when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
<i>Every Man in his Humour</i> was in course of composition, and it ended
just about a month before 'Bengemen' passed a rapier through
Gabriel Spenser in Hoxton Fields.</p>

<p>Beside the playwrights already mentioned, Porter must have
known in varying degrees of intimacy Heywood, Haughton, Day,
Munday, Chapman, Hathaway, and, perhaps, Rankins, who were
then writing for the company; also Samuel Rowley and Martin
Slater, who appear to have been serving as actor-dramatists. With
the players Downton, Richard Alleyn, Robert Shaw, and the polyonymous
William Bird, Porter was associated in various business
negotiations. Of course he knew the above-mentioned Gabriel
Spenser, and Henslowe's son-in-law, Edward Alleyn, and the two
Jeffes, and Towne and Singer, and the other active members of the
company.</p>

<p>Most of the playwrights in Henslowe's pay lived in hand-to-mouth
style; but in art of cozening groats from the manager who
in turn squeezed angels from the dramatist, none excelled 'Harey'
Chettle. It is instructive to note that, from the period of close
intimacy with Chettle, Porter sinks ever deeper in Henslowe's debt.
On January 17, 1599, he had borrowed a pound of Henslowe.
He was then, still, in the heyday of his success; but only six weeks
later, February 28, we find Henslowe, under cover of a further
beggarly advance, acquiring a lien on all his productivity. A few
days after that the two 'Hareys,' doubtless with a hope of release
from the moneylender's grip, are sweating out <i>The Spencers</i> for him;
and Chettle, with or without Porter's knowledge, is borrowing
another half-sovereign in earnest of its completion. When, on
March 22, the joint production is finished, the dramatists are paid
less for it than <i>The Second Part of the Two Angry Women</i> had brought
to Porter alone; and before it is acted Porter has given his note of
hand to Henslowe for another pound; and so proceeds the declension
of 'Harey' Porter. Between December 16, 1596, and
June 26, 1598, he had been Henslowe's 'Mr. Porter'; as soon as
he begins to borrow, January 17, 1599, he is 'Harey' with a rare
reversion to the ancient style; after April 7 there is no reversion.
The loans, too, which at first were of a dignified amount, suddenly
fall to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Familiarity has bred as usual; and, by April 16,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
'Harey,' who at this time owes the manager 25<i>s.</i>, is compelled in
consideration of 1<i>s.</i> to clear his debt on the morrow or forfeit £10.
Next day Shylock has him, but for some reason continues to dribble
out the sixpences until May 26. Then 'Harey' signs the last
I. O. U. of which we have record, and drops out of history and
Henslowe with as little warning as he had entered.</p>

<p><b>Date of the Extant Play.</b>&mdash;Porter wrote two plays and engaged
to write a third on the <i>Women of Abington</i>. Of a First Part of the
<i>Two Angry Women</i>, there is no record in Henslowe, at least under
that name. But of the Second Part the entries of December 22,
1598, and February 12, 1599, make explicit mention; and an
intervening note of January 31, 1599, which records an outlay for
the play without specification of the part is by date and position
evidently a reference to this same Second Part. According to the
entries of February 12, the sum of £2 was on that day expended
in a concluding purchase of properties for the performance, and an
equal amount was given to Porter in final payment for the "boocke"
entitled <i>the 2 pte. of the angry wemen of abington</i>. So closes all
record of that second part. The payment of £2, two weeks later,
February 28, is the usual advance "in earneste of" a "boocke"
not yet finished; but the title of it was <i>the ij mery women of abenton</i>,
and it was undoubtedly intended to be a continuation of the general
theme. There is, however, no record of final payment (of £4
or £5) as in other cases, and no proof that the play was completed.
I have no doubt that the play of which the text is here
given, <i>The Pleasant History of the Two Angry Women of Abington</i>, is
the unrecorded First Part, above mentioned. Our drama was twice
printed in 1599 "as it was lately playde by ... the ... Admirall
his servants," and it had, in all probability, been in the possession
of the company for some time before publication; whereas the
Second Part was only first acted in that year, and would not, with
the consent of the company, have been turned over to printers.
For it was to the player's interest to restrict his dramatic stock-in-trade,
while it was novel, to the play-house. That the non-extant
play of December 22, 1598-February 12, 1599, which is explicitly
called the Second Part, was preceded by <i>The Pleasant History</i> is,
moreover, confirmed by the title-page of <i>The Pleasant History</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
is unconscious of predecessor and sequel alike. By how long a
period, then, did our play precede the missing Second Part? The
words "as it was lately playde" on the title-pages of both editions
may or may not be advertisement. But there is, at any rate, no
likelihood that the first performance antedated May 14, 1594, when
the Admiral's men began their long engagement with Henslowe;
nor that it fell between that date and December 16, 1596, for it
does not appear (nor any name that suggests it) in Henslowe's consecutive
list of plays performed by the Admiral's men during that
period. And since Henslowe observed his method of entry by
days and plays until November 5, 1597, the <i>Pleasant History</i> would
have been specified in that part of the diary<a name="FNanchor_1609_1609" id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> if the first payment to
Porter, December 16, 1596, or the loan of the succeeding March 7,
had been for a play bearing that name. Since there is no mention
of a <i>Pleasant History of the Two Angry Women of Abington</i> before the
close of Henslowe's daily register, nor of a <i>First Part of the Two
Angry Women</i> between that date and December 22, 1598, when
negotiations are in progress for a Second Part, it would seem that,
whether our play came into existence before or after November
5, 1597, it must have first passed under some other name.</p>

<p>In the former alternative not even the wildest conjecture can identify
it with any title recorded by Henslowe before March 7, 1597,
except <i>Woman Hard to Please</i>, and that is more suitable to the subject
of Heywood's <i>Challenge for Beauty</i> than of our <i>Pleasant History</i>.
It is not until two months after the loan of March 7&mdash;four pounds
to Porter&mdash;that one comes upon the first performance of the only
play of that period that can at all correspond with the <i>Pleasant History.</i>
This is the successful but as yet unidentified <i>Comodey of Umers</i>,
for the writing of which Henslowe records no payment, although he
marks it "new" and makes entries which show that it was acted no
less than twelve times at his "howsse" between May 11 and
October 11 of that year, and that it supplanted <i>Alexander</i> and <i>That
Will Be</i> in the favour of the public. It has been held, to be sure,
that this anonymous <i>Comodey</i> was <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>; but
that is impossible, for Ben Jonson himself states that <i>Every Man</i>
was brought out during the next year, 1598, and not by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>Admiral's, but by the Lord Chamberlain's servants,<a name="FNanchor_1610_1610" id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> while Henslowe
includes <i>The (Comodey of) Umers</i> even the year after it had been
acted by the Admiral's company in his "Note of all such bookes as
belong to the Stocke [of that same company], and such as I have
bought since the 3d of Marche, 1598."<a name="FNanchor_1611_1611" id="FNanchor_1611_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> Mr. Fleay thinks that
the <i>Comodey</i> was Chapman's <i>Humerous Dayes Mirth</i>, and Dr. Ward
inclines to accept the conjecture; but I think that Mr. Fleay's plea
in favour of Chapman's play will apply as well to Porter's <i>Pleasant
History</i>, the subtitle of which advertises "the humorous mirth of
Dick Coomes and Nicholas Proverbes," while the scenes develop
"humours," which are much more natural than those of Chapman's
play, and fall but little short, indeed, of the quality that characterizes
B. J.'s <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>. As far as plot goes I cannot for
a moment believe that the ineptitudes of the <i>Humerous Dayes Mirth</i>
can have commanded the popularity which was achieved by the
<i>Comodey of Umers</i>.</p>

<p>If, however, according to the latter alternative, the <i>Pleasant History</i>
came into existence between November 5, 1597, and December 22,
1598, the attempt to identify it with the <i>Comodey of Umers</i> falls to
the ground. But another possibility at once presents itself: for
the only mention by Henslowe of a play produced in the interim by
Porter alone is of "a boocke called <i>Love Prevented</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1612_1612" id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a> For this a
payment of £4 is made on May 30, 1598; and until <i>Love Prevented</i>
turns up, and turns out to be other than our play, it will be open to
conjecture whether under this title we have not the earliest record
of the <i>Pleasant History of the Two Angry Women</i>. For not only is
this the sole title assigned to Porter alone during the period under
consideration, it is also a title fairly descriptive of the central movement
of the <i>Pleasant History</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1613_1613" id="FNanchor_1613_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a> The date of payment, moreover,
would accord with the assertion of recent performance which appears
upon the title-page of our play as printed; it would also allow for a
reasonable lapse of time before the publication, which was not by
license and was probably of a printed copy. If this conjecture be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>correct, the date of our play is May 30, 1598; and we have an
explanation, in part, of Henslowe's increased receipts during the
month following. If, on the other hand, our play be the <i>Comodey
of Umers</i>, the date of its first presentation is May 11, 1597.
Whether these identifications be correct or not, the play may be
dated between December 16, 1596, and December 22, 1598, and
it was probably known to Meres when during the latter year he
included Porter among the writers of comedy.<a name="FNanchor_1614_1614" id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a></p>

<p><b>Dramatic Qualities: Construction.</b>&mdash;Of the plot we may cry with
Goursey, "Here's adoe about a thing of nothing." Not this, but
occasional situations and the subconscious qualities of humour and
verisimilitude lend distinction to the play. The <i>Pleasant History</i>
has atmosphere and therefore entity. It is a creation. Its characters
stand out. Porter knew their ways and words before he knew
their history. He had met them out Cumnor way or Hinksey,
by Bagley, Abington, and Milton on many a cross-country stroll.
What basis there was for Mrs. Barnes's jealousy, whether Master
Barnes had too often gone to Milton "a-hunting or such ordinary
sports," and, once too often, "chatted with" Mrs. Goursey "all
day till night," we are not explicitly informed. Nor is the dramatist.
That Mrs. Goursey has given no cause for offence goes without
saying. But there is trouble in the air. The wives are angered:
after a dissension sufficiently prolonged to afford us an insight into
them and their surroundings, their wrath shall be appeased. How,
we know not; nor does the dramatist, but it seems to him natural,
if not novel, that the son and daughter of these foes should with
their marriage "bury their parents' strife." That end he pursues,
carrying all with him except those whom he most would carry.
When the hour is nigh and we are expectant, and the star-crossed
lovers have made for Carfax to be wed, they lose each other and
everybody else in a midsummer night's "cunny greene," where,
whence, and whither, darkling, the dramatic persons play blindman's
buff with the plot till, frustrate of discovery, they despair.
Then in steps Sir Raph Smith, <i>ex tenebris et machina</i>, to find the
heroine, and prophesy solution and "the lanthorne of the day" and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>lend our hopes a fillip, but straight to lose us worse than ever in the
devious night. Beholders and beheld all now despair. And Porter
might still be spasmodically rounding his rabbits into the "cunny
greene" and out again, had not the quarrelsome wives happened
each on other, and on them in turn their husbands happened,
who simulating mortal combat succeed at last in terrifying their
women into peace. Only after the characters most concerned
have thus by chance taken the solution into their own hands and
effected the reconciliation, does the peacemaker intended by the
dramatist drop in with the lost sweetheart on his arm; and the
union of the young lovers, which had been designed to promote
the union of their mothers, proceeds on its own merits, superfluous,
like the second tail on the proverbial toad. The plot, therefore,
is not the "thing." Not only does it pursue half a dozen possibilities,
each of which it drops halfway; it starts another half-dozen,
which it never pursues. But the auditor, unforewarned, pricks to
each wild-goose chase in turn. The complication of the angry
women and the subplot of the lovers, with its pretence of a solution,
move rapidly through the first, third, sixth, and eighth scenes; but
in the second and fourth the farcical element retards the pace; in
the seventh a new and futile start is made, and in the ninth the
<i>platt</i> itself slides into a kind of <i>commedia all' improviso</i>. From this
it is rescued at the beginning of Scene xii. by Master Barnes's
"pollicie." But although his "drift device" is of the utmost
importance to the audience, I have my doubts whether any hearer
has caught the hint, and I am sure that to most readers the sham
combat between the husbands in Scene xiv. comes as something
impromptu and secondary. Consequently a luxury of anticipation
has been forfeited. The "pollicie" is in itself a capital ruse
for curing shrewishness, and it has been frequently used of later
years, as, for instance, in Gillette's <i>Because She Loved Him So</i>; but
in 1597 it had the additional charm of novelty, and deserved a
better handling. The situation in Scene vi., where Mrs.
Goursey snatches and restores her husband's letter, is, conversely,
well prepared, but lacks all consequent. The marksman draws
his bow to the top of its bent, then gradually relaxes the tension&mdash;because
he has forgot his arrow. But, though Porter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
guilty of imperfect devices, few English comedies before his time
can boast of scenes more realistic and humorous than the game at
tables, the burlesque wooing of Mall at her window, and the comic
irony of the climax between the disputatious mothers under whose
beaks the debated chickens are eloping. In fact, with all crudities,
the plot develops an interesting individuality, for which the author
does not seem to be at all responsible; none the less interesting if
"a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard
from the hip upward, no doublet."</p>

<p><b>Portrayal of Character.</b>&mdash;When we turn to the "persons" and
their "humours" we realize the architectonics of the play. There
is something at once natural and masterly in the ease with which
Porter introduces the condition of "neighbour amitie," wherewith
the masters delude themselves, while their spouses blow upon
the coals of hatred: the hostess, teeming with innuendo,&mdash;"malice
embowelled in her tongue,"&mdash;the lady of Milton read in
Æsop's fables, quick to conjecture, and "every day as good as
Barnes's wife," whether to divert a moral or direct a curse. And
as the women promise they develop: Mrs. Barnes, a "jealous,
slandering, spiteful queane"; Mrs. Goursey, subtler and fairer
spoken, but incapable of backgammon "if slanders by doe talke,"&mdash;patently
obedient, but impatient of rebuke, soothing her husband
with soft words, but, inward, fuming at his "Peace, be quiet, wife";
easily his better, bidding him "grow to the housetop with your anger,
Sir," and then humouring his pleasure, not because of his "incensement,"
but his "health." The opprobrious epithets of Barnes's wife
Mistress Goursey returns into her teeth; damns her as "mankind";
takes up the quarrel last and is last to lay it down. In fact, as
Mistress Goursey is the more independent of the twain, she is also
historically the more original. Mrs. Barnes, on the other hand, is
an amalgam of stock shrews, gossips, and jealous wives: a descendant
of Tom Tyler's more strenuous half, a kinswoman of Dame Chat, a
Kitely in petticoats, the remote grandmother of Colman's Mrs. Oakly.</p>

<p>Barnes and Goursey are henpecked husbands of the remordent
variety. Barnes, the more experienced in domestic infelicity, is
correspondingly the more given to moral tags and pregnant sentences.
He sometimes rises almost to poetry, as when he tells his wife:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
"Rough, wrathful words</div>
<div class="i0">Are bastards got by rashness in the thoughts;"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="noin">from bathos he is just saved by a sense of the incongruous: "O
doe not" begs he of the virago whom he styles "sweete,"</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"O, doe not set the organ of thy voice</div>
<div class="i0">On such a grunting tone of discontent!</div>
<div class="i0">Doe not deforme the beautie of thy tongue</div>
<div class="i0">With such mishapen answeres."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">It is appropriate that upon him who has given rise to the brief
unpleasantness by inviting guests without his wife's consent, should
rest the <i>onus</i> of devising the effective "pollicie" of reconciliation.</p>

<p>From him Goursey is well differenced. Possessed of a finer
wife and a quicker temper, when the former, contrary to expectation,
crosses the latter he well-nigh falls into an apoplexy. Oaths he
abhors, but in the access of his rage swears horribly and apologizes
to the Almighty between breaths.</p>

<p>That the morals of the sons reproduce those of the sires in their
salad days, I reluctantly suspect. It is the recital of young Frank's
licentiousness that convinces young Philip that here is just the husband
for Sister Mall. And&mdash;considering that Mall is frankly and
squarely what her mother calls her, a "lustie guts" and "vile girl,"
in fact her mother's daughter, fit to "floute the devill and make
blush the boldest face of man that ere man saw" a swearing wench
whose only claim to morals is unmorality&mdash;Philip's judgment is
correct. There is, in my opinion, no coarser-minded girl in Elizabethan
comedy; and at the same time there obtains no dramatic
portrayal of the animal more observantly conceived or more
faithfully executed. That she is, as Mr. Ellis says, less sophisticated
than Congreve's Prue, is not exactly to her credit. Nor
need I make her out "a wholesome, robust English girl ... with a
brave openness, loving and sincere," in order to justify my appreciation
of Porter's skill in creating her. She is, indeed, robust
and Elizabethan, seventeen and upward; but within she is a
mate for Caliban; no relation to Prue,&mdash;rather a link between
Wapull's Wilful Wanton and Vanbrugh's Hoyden. It is hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
necessary to point out the literary and dramatic affinities of Sir
Raph and his wife: the buck-hunting squire and the lady tender-hearted
and "pitous."</p>

<p>The foregoing are characters of broad outline; but each has, as
well, his quirk of conduct, manners, or of style. The jealous wife
with her "stopt compares"; "Mistresse Would-Have," who has
"let restrainèd fancy lose," and sworn to lead no apes in hell; her
brother, a poet at second-hand, and "sick discourser" of his sister's
wit; Nan Lawson's lover of "quick invention" and "pleasure-aiming
mind,"&mdash;these and others of the major movement are
as palpably in their "humours" as Mrs. Otter, Doll Common,
Master Stephen, or Kitely, or Truewit. And when we turn to the
secondary group we find the "humours" not only advertised upon
the title-page but specified in the text. Dick Coomes is "humord
bluntly" to brag and swear and drink and quarrel and talk bawdy.
"I see, by this dearth of good swords, that dearth of sword-and-buckler
fight begins to grow out; I am sorry for it," complains this
swashbuckler serving-man. With "Sbloud!" he comes upon the
stage, and there's little left of God unhallowed when Coomes subsides
beneath his buckler in the dark. "Why, what a swearing
keeps this drunken asse," exclaims Francis. "Peace, do not marre
his <i>humour</i>," Phil replies. "Away, bawdie man," cries Hodge,
and even the Boy must say, "Here him no more, maister; he doth
bedawbe ye with his durty speche." He has a "merrie <i>humour</i>,"
too, this Coomes, of punning, and has brought "the apparell of
his wit ... into fashion of an honor." A Thraso of the servants'
hall, he'll outswear any 'Pharaoh's foot' of a tailor's shop. He
can dispute precedence with Ancient Pistol as "the foul-mouthedst
rogue in England"; and when he's in his "quarreling <i>humour</i>," not
Pistol, nor Bobadil, nor the 'humorous' Nim could swagger to
Dawson's close or out of a horse-pond with a more humorous grace.
It is to be noted that, in his first lines, Coomes animadverts upon
"the humour of those young springals," his masters, who "will
spend all their fathers' good at gaming"; also that Philip's servingman
has his humour both of manners and of style: "a spruce
slave," cross-gartered like Malvolio, "a nosegay bound with laces
in his hat," "all proverbes in his speech ... because he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
speak truth," a dramatic Camden or Ray, who quotes Latin withal,
and is as marked in his "humour" as Coomes and Franke's Boy,
and Mall and Mrs. Barnes in theirs.</p>

<p><b>Place in the History of Comedy.</b>&mdash;It would, therefore, be of no
small importance to determine whether this <i>Pleasant History</i> is
Henslowe's <i>Comodey of Umers</i> of May 11, 1597; for if it be, this
play of characteristics precedes <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, and disputes
the "place peculiar to itself in our dramatic literature" which
most critics have assigned to that masterpiece of Ben Jonson. But
even if it be not the play of May 11, 1597, our drama was certainly
written before December 22, 1598, probably by May 30 of that
year; and consequently to Porter, as an influential associate of
Chapman and Jonson, must be given something of the credit of
blazing the path toward the comedy of characteristic. The fun
of the play has at once a Chaucerian shrewdness and a something
of the careless guffaw of W. Wager. Its realism throws back to
<i>Mak</i>, and <i>Johan</i>, <i>Tom Tyler</i> and <i>Gammer Gurton</i>. As a comedy of
unadulterated native flavour, breathing rural life and manners and
the modern spirit, constructed with knowledge of the stage, and
without affectation or constraint, it has no foregoing analogue except
perhaps <i>The Pinner of Wakefield</i>. No play preceding or contemporary
yields an easier conversational prose, not even the <i>Merry Wives</i>.</p>

<p>We must not close this study without remarking certain resemblances
to Shakespeare. In the matter of situations and language
traces of the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> of 1592, and the <i>Midsummer-Night's
Dream</i> of 1594-1595, appear. The fanciful reader might, indeed,
suspect something like a good-natured burlesque of the balcony scene
in the conversation between Frank and Mall "at her window";
perhaps even of the <i>motif</i> of Shakespeare's tragedy, in the loves of
the children of the inimical wives of Abington: "How, sir? your
wife!" says Mrs. Barnes to Francis:&mdash;</p>

<p>If anything further were needed to illustrate Philip's taste in plays,
it would be furnished by the hazy reminiscence of "the imperial
votaress" and "the nun, for aye ... in shady cloister mewed."
Indeed, if Porter did not have in mind the quadrilateral wanderings of
the <i>Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> when Frank and Mall missed the way
to Carfax, I am much surprised. That Dick Coomes, when he
stood between his mistress and the angel to be tempted, was not
thinking of Gobbo, is, of course, possible, but it is not possible
that Dick Coomes's creator was not familiar with the <i>Merchant
of Venice</i>. There is also, as I have already implied, a quality in
Dick's sword-and-buckler voice that rings contemporaneous with
the <i>Henry IV., Pts. I. and II.</i> To trace a connection between the
well-known lines of <i>Hamlet</i> in 1602 and Porter's</p>

<p class="noin">(1597-98), would, I fear, be fanciful. The resemblance, faint as
it is, may be due to mere coincidence or to derivation from a common
source.</p>

<p><b>Previous Editions and the Present Text.</b>&mdash;Two editions of this
play were published in 1599: one for Joseph Hunt and William
Ferbrand; the other for Ferbrand alone (in same place of business).
From the variations in spelling and text which characterize the
Ferbrand quarto and are evidently intended for improvements, and
from the fact that Ferbrand was still alone when, in 1600, he published
another play, <i>Look About You</i>, I conclude that the edition
printed during the period of partnership was the earlier of the two.
It will be indicated in the notes to the present text as Q 1. Of Q 1
a copy is to be found in the British Museum (162. d. 55). Of
Q 2, published by Ferbrand alone, there are two copies in the
Bodleian, one formerly owned by Malone, the other by Douce.
Q 2 furnishes the more careful text. That it was made, however,
not from manuscript, but from Q 1, is evidenced by the retention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
of occasional printers' errors and oddities characteristic of the earlier
edition. Dyce, in his edition (Dy.) for the Percy Society, 1841,
followed Q 1, with occasional readings from Q 2 and silent
emendations. This edition, with modernized spelling, is included
in Hazlitt's <i>Dodsley</i>, Vol. VII. (H.). Mr. Havelock Ellis's edition
of the play (E.), with acts, scenes, and modernized spelling, for the
Mermaid Series (<i>Nero and Other Plays</i>, 1888), appears to be based
upon H. The present text is that of Q 2 (Bodl. Malone 184),
with such substitutes from Q 1 as are indicated in the footnotes.</p>

</h3>

<p>Gentlemen, I come to yee like one that lackes and would borrow,
but was loath to aske least hee should be denied: I would aske, but
I would aske to obtaine; O would I knewe that manner of asking!
To beg were base, and to cooche low and to carry an humble shew
of entreatie were too dog-like, that fawnes on his maister to get a
bone from his trencher: out, curre! I cannot abide it to put on the
shape and habit of this new worlds new found beggars, mistermed
souldiers, as thus; 'Sweet gentlemen, let a poore scholler implore
and exorate<a name="FNanchor_1616_1616" id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> that you would make him rich in the possession of a
mite of your favours, to keep him a true man in wit, and to pay for
his lodging among the Muses! so God him helpe, he is driven to a
most low estate: tis not unknowne what service of words he hath
been at; hee lost his lims in a late conflict of floute; a brave repulse
and a hot assault it was, he doth protest, as ever he saw since hee
knewe what the report of a volley of jestes were; he shall therefore
desire you'&mdash;A plague upon it, each beadle disdained would
whip him from your companie. Well, gentlemen, I cannot tell
howe to get your favours better then by desert: then the worse
lucke, or the worse wit, or some what, for I shall not now deserve
it. Welcome<a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> then, I commit my selfe to my fortunes, and your
contents; contented to dye, if your severe judgements shall judge
me to be stung to death with the adders hisse.</p>

SHAKESPEARE AS A COMIC DRAMATIST</h3>

<p><b>The Essentials of Shakespearian Comedy.</b>&mdash;The Comedies of
Shakespeare, which form more than a third part of his dramatic
work, belong to every period of his career as a writer, except one.
During a few years, soon after the opening of the seventeenth century,
he turned away from comedy, or rather he was drawn by
some irresistible attraction to explore the tragic depths of life, and
for a time its bright or variegated surface was lost to view. The
results of his passionate inquisition of evil entered into the spirit
of his latest plays, which we might name "romances" rather than
"comedies," and hence the study of Shakespeare's lighter and
brighter work cannot be wholly dissociated from the study of that
in which terror and pity are the presiding powers.</p>

<p>To conceive Shakespearian comedy aright we must disconnect
the word "comedy" from the associations derived from its adjectives
"comic" and "comical"; we must recognize the fact that, though
laughter is one of its incidents, laughter is not its end. Our chief
living master of the carte and tierce of wit, Mr. George Meredith,
describes folly as the natural prey of the comic spirit, "known to
it in all her transformations, in every disguise; and it is with the
springing delight of hawk over heron, hound after fox, that it gives
her chase, never fretting, never tiring, sure of having her, allowing
her no rest." Shakespeare's comedy includes the intellectual delight
of chasing down folly and being in at the death, but this is not its
main purpose. Nor is he eager to assume the part of the indignant
moral satirist. It is not he but Ben Jonson, in the person of Asper,
who announces that "with an armèd and resolvèd hand" he will</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">"Strip the ragged follies of their time</div>
<div class="i0">Naked as at their birth &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
<div class="i6">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; and with a whip of steel</div>
<div class="i0">Print wounding lashes in their iron ribs."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>
Shakespeare on occasions can wield the whip of steel, but it is
when for a time he parts company with the spirit of comedy.
Moral truth radiates through all the world of his creation, but he
does not suppose that morality is served by being outrageously
moral; in writing comedy he has more faith in sunshine as a sanative
agent than in lightning and tempest. If he is ever contemptuous,
it is because the pitifulness of such a baffled pretender as
Parolles, or of such lean-witted conspirators as Antonio and Sebastian,
admits of no other feeling. From personal satire he, unlike
several of his contemporaries, wholly abstained, unless, indeed, the
theory holds good, which finds in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> that purge
given by the player Shakespeare&mdash;so Kempe tells Burbage in <i>The
Return from Parnassus</i>&mdash;to the pestilent fellow, Ben Jonson.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is impossible to include under any single general conception
works which differ from each other as widely as <i>The Comedy
of Errors</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>, and <i>The Tempest</i>; but if we cannot
seize it as a whole, we may see from a little distance this side and
that of comedy as understood by Shakespeare. Its vital centre is
not an idea, an abstraction, a doctrine, a moral thesis, but something
concrete&mdash;persons involved in an action. When philosophical
critics assure us that the theme of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> is
expressed by the words <i>Summum jus, summa injuria</i>, or that it
exhibits "man in relation to money," we admire the motto they
discovered in their nut, and prefer the kernel in our own. The
persons and the action are placed in some region, which is neither
wholly one of fantasy nor yet one encumbered with the dross of
actuality. Aery spirits, an earth-born Caliban, Robingoodfellow,
the king and queen of Faery, may make their incursion into it, yet
it is in the truest sense the haunt and home of "human mortals."
The finer spirit of the poet's own age is forever present, but he
makes no laborious effort to imitate life in the lower sense of reproducing
contemporary manners. He turns away from his own
country. Once&mdash;by command&mdash;Sir John Falstaff makes love to
the laughing bourgeois wives of Windsor; but to comply with the
necessity Shakespeare's comedy descends from verse to prose. Ben
Jonson's invention is at home in Cob's Court and Picthatch, in the
aisle of Paul's, or among the booths of Bartholomew Fair; having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
disguised the characters of his first important play under Italian
names, he rightly christened them anew as Londoners. Shakespeare's
imagination, throwing off the burden of the actual, desported
itself in the Athenian moonlit wood and on the yellow sands
of the enchanted island, under green boughs in Arden, in the garden
at Belmont, in the palace of Illyria, at the shepherd's festival in
Bohemia.</p>

<p>The action corresponds with the environment. In the great
tragedies Shakespeare may on rare occasions demand certain postulates
at the outset. These having been granted, the plot evolves
itself within the bounds of the credible. In <i>King Lear</i> the opening
scene puts some strain upon our imaginative belief, but Shakespeare
received the legend as it had been handed down to him, and all that
follows the opening scene&mdash;though the action is vast and monstrous&mdash;obeys
an order and logic which compel our acquiescence. It
is not always so, if we refuse its claims to fancy, in Shakespearian
comedy. In a region which borders on the realm of fantasy we
must be prepared to accept many happy surprises. Our desire for
happiness inclines our hearts to a pleasant credulity; if chance at
the right moment intervenes, it comes as our own embodied hope.
When all and every one in Arden wood, save Jaques, are on their
way to wedlock, like couples coming to the ark, we are not disposed
to question the reality of that old religious man upon the borders
of the forest who suddenly converts the usurping Duke, and turns
back the mighty power which he had set on foot. We are grateful
for such hermits and such convertites.</p>

<p>The characters again correspond in comedy with the environment
and with the action. In tragedy character is either from the
first fully formed and four-square, or, if it is developed by events,
it develops in accordance with an internal law. Passion runs its
inevitable course, like a great wave driven of the wind, and breaks
with thunder upon the shoal of death. The human actors disappear;
only the general order of the world and the eternal moral
law endure. But in comedy the individual must be preserved, and
must at the close enter into possession of happy days; if he has erred
through folly or vice, his error has not been mortal; he may in the
last scene of the fifth act swiftly change his moral disposition as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span>
would change his outward garb. The traitor Proteus is suddenly
restored to his better mind, and Valentine is generous enough to
resign to the repentant traitor all his rights in Silvia. Bertram,
who almost to the last entangles himself in a network of dastardly
lies, is rescued from his dishonesty and foolish pride by a successful
trick, and becomes the loyal husband of Helena. The Duke
Orsino transfers his amorous homage from his "fancy's queen"
Olivia to his "fancy's queen" Viola with a most convenient facility.
Angelo discovers his own baseness in the moment when he perceives
it is discovered by the world, and is straightway virtuous enough to
bring the happiness required by a fifth act to the wronged Mariana.
Even Iachimo&mdash;the Iago of a comedy&mdash;makes sorrowful confession
of his villany, and restores the purloined bracelet and the
ill-won ring. Such transformations as these indicate that even as
regards character the law of comedy is a law of liberty. When
it suits Shakespeare's purpose, the study of character can be profound
and veracious; when occasion requires it, incident becomes all-important,
and character yields to the requirements of the situation.</p>

<p>In truth, while it may be said that in Shakespearian tragedy character
is fate, in Shakespearian comedy, among the contrasts and surprises
which form so abundant a source of its vivacity, not the least
effective contrast is that of character set over, as it were, against
itself, not the least effective surprise is that of character entering
upon new phases under the play of circumstance. The unity and
logic of character may not in reality be impaired, but the unity is
realized in and through diversity. In punning, a word is made to
play a double part; it jostles its other self, and laughter ensues.
What is so single and indivisible as personality? But if John is
mistaken for Thomas, accident seems to triumph over law, and the
incongruity arises of a doubled personal identity&mdash;the apparent and
the real. Antipholus, of Syracuse, like the little woman of the nursery
rhyme, whose sense of personality was dependent on the length
of her petticoats, is almost persuaded that he is other than himself.
If Viola disguises in doublet and hose, she secures by anticipation
the victory of Sebastian over Olivia's heart, while in her own heart
she endures a woman's hidden love for the Duke. One man in
his brief time on Shakespeare's comic stage may play many parts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
The ascetic scholars of Navarre are transformed into the most gallant
of lovers and the most ingenious of sonneteers. Katherine the
curst becomes more resolute in her wifely submission than she had
been in her virgin <i>sauvagerie</i>. Signior Benedick, who challenged
Cupid at the flight, in due time alters to Benedick, the married
man; my dear Lady Disdain, in pity for him, and a little in pity
for herself, has yielded upon great persuasion. If, as Montaigne
teaches us, man is the most variable of animals, perhaps we learn
as important a truth about human nature from Shakespeare's
comedies as from his more profound study of the fatality of character
and passion in the tragedies.</p>

<p>The essentials of Shakespearian comedy at its best are, after all,
simple and obvious enough&mdash;a delightful story, conducted, in some
romantic region, by gracious and gallant persons, thwarted or aided
by the mirthful god, Circumstance, and arriving at a fortunate
issue. Such would not serve as a description of the comedies of
Ben Jonson. He is pleased to keep us during the greater part of
five laborious acts in the company of knaves and gulls, and at the
close, poetic justice is satisfied with the detection of folly and a
general retribution descending on evil-doers. Shakespeare, in comedy,
is no such remorseless justicer. Don John, the bastard, is
reserved for punishment, but it shall be upon the morrow, and the
punishment shall be such as the mirthful Benedick may devise.
Parolles escapes lightly with the laughter of Lafeu, and mockery,
qualified by a supper, will not afflict him beyond endurance. Lucio
is condemned to marry the mother of his child, which is so dire an
evil that all other forfeits are remitted. Sir John Falstaff will join
the rest by Mistress Page's country fire in jesting at his own discomfiture.
Even Shylock is not wholly overwhelmed; he shall
have godfathers and a godmother at his baptism, and remain in possession
of half his worldly goods. Sebastian may live and discover
that he is morally superior to Caliban, the thief, and Stephano, the
drunkard. Iachimo kneels and receives the free forgiveness of
Posthumus.</p>

<p>But if Shakespeare, in comedy, is niggard of punishment, he is
liberal in rewards. And since almost all the stories he chooses for
his comic stage are stories of love and lovers, what grand reward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
can be reserved for the fifth act so fitting as the reward of love?
In the seventeenth century masque amid all its mythological, fantastic,
or humorous diversities, one point, or pivot, of the action
remained fixed&mdash;the incidents must give occasion to a dance of the
masquers. So in Shakespearian comedy we may, with almost equal
certainty, reckon upon a marriage, or more marriages than one, in
act, or in immediate prospect, before the curtain closes. Or, if not
a marriage, for the lovers may be wedded lovers at the opening,
then, after division, or separation of husband and wife, what we
may call a remarriage, with misunderstandings cleared up and faults
forgiven. When Shakespeare wrote his earlier plays he was himself
young, and his gaze was fixed upon the future; exultant lovers
begin their new life, and the song of joy is an epithalamium. When
he wrote his latest plays, he was no longer young, and he thought
of the blessedness of recovering the happy past, of knitting anew
the strained or broken bonds of life, of connecting the former and
the latter days in natural piety. Youth still must have its rapture;
Florizel must win his royal shepherdess, queen of curds and cream;
the nuptials of Ferdinand and Miranda, "these, our dear-beloved,"
must be duly solemnized at Naples; but Shakespeare's temper is no
longer the temper of youth; he is of the company of Hermione
and Prospero, and the music of the close is a grave and spiritual
harmony.</p>

<p>Between the first scene and the last the path in comedy is beset
with obstacles and dangers, past which love must find a way&mdash;"the
course of true love never did run smooth." These may be
either internal&mdash;some difficulty arising from character, or external&mdash;difference
of blood or of rank, the choice of friends, slanderous
tongues, rival passions, the spite of fortune. The resolution of the
difficulty must be of a corresponding kind; temper, or rash determination,
must yield to the predominance of love, or the external
obstacles must be removed by well-directed effort, or by a happy
turn of events. The young king of Navarre and his fellow-students
are immured by their ascetic vow of culture; Isabella is all
but ceremonially pledged to the life of religion; Olivia is secluded
by her luxury of sentimental sorrow; Beatrice, born to be a lover,
is at odds with love through her pride of independence and wilful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
mirth; Bertram has the young colt's pleasure in freedom, refuses to
be ranged, and suffers from the haughty blindness of youth, which
cannot recognize its own chief need and highest gain. All such
rebels against love will be subdued in good time. On the other
hand, it is her father who has decreed that Hermia shall be parted
from Lysander; both father and mother have rival designs for
marring the destiny of sweet Nan Page; a false friend and fickle
lover separates Valentine and Silvia; a malignant plotter, who
would avenge on all happy creatures the wrong of his own base
birth, strikes down Hero with the blow of slander as she stands
before the altar. But love has on its side gallantry and resource,
loyalty and valour, the good powers of nature and the magic of the
moonlit faery wood; and so, over the mountains and over the
waves, love at last finds out a way.</p>

<p>Love being the central theme of Shakespearian comedy, laughter
cannot be its principal end, and cruel or harsh laughter is almost
necessarily excluded. But the laughter of joy rings out in the earlier
and middle comedies, and a smile, beautiful in its wisdom and
serenity, illuminates the comedies of his closing period. If satire is
present, it is only on rare occasions a satire of manners; it deals
rather with something universal, a satire of the fatuity of self-lovers,
of the power which the human heart has of self-deception, or it is a
genial mockery of the ineptitude of brainless self-importance, or
the little languid lover's amorous endeavours, or the lumbering pace
of heavy-witted ignorance, which cannot catch a common meaning,
even by the tail; at its average rate of progress the idea whisks too
swiftly from the view of such slow gazers.</p>

<p><i>The dramatis personæ</i> form a large and varied population, ranging
in social rank from the king to the tinker and the bellows-mender.
Princes, dukes, courtiers, pages, dissolute gallants, soldiers, sailors,
shepherds, clowns, city mechanicals, the country justice, the constable
and head-borough, the schoolmaster, the parson, the faithful
old servant, the lively waiting-maid, roysterers, humourists, light-fingered
rogues, foreign fantasticoes, middle-class English husbands
and wives, Welshman, Frenchman, Spaniard, Italian, Jew, noble
and gracious ladies, country wenches, courtesans, childhood, youth,
manhood, old age, the maiden, the wife, the widow&mdash;all sorts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
conditions of human mortals occupy the scene, while on this side
enters Caliban, bearing his burden of pine-logs, and Ariel flies overhead
upon the bat's back, on the other, the offended king of faery
frowns upon Titania, and claims his pretty Eastern minion.</p>

<p>The characters are ordinarily ranged, with an excellent effect
on dramatic perspective, in three groups or divisions. The lovers
and their immediate friends or rivals occupy the middle plane.
Above them are persons of influence or authority by virtue of age
or rank, on whom in some measure the fortunes of the lovers
depend. Below them are the humbler aiders and abettors of their
designs, or subordinate figures lightly attached to the central action,
yet sometimes playing into the hands of benevolent Chance, and
always ready to diversify the scene, to enliven the stage, to afford a
breathing-space between passages of high-wrought emotion, to fill
an interval with glittering word-play or unconscious humour, to
save romance from shrill intensity or too aerial ascension by the
contact of reality. Shakespeare in comedy was hardly quite happy
until he had found his Duke and his clown; then he had the space
in which he could move at ease; love remains his central theme,
but it is love which rises out of life; his principal figures are rendered
more distinct, are seen more in the round, because they stand
out from a rich and various background.</p>

<p><b>Intrigue; and the Treatment of Materials.</b>&mdash;The intrigue of
Shakespeare's comedies is seldom of his own creation. He understood
by "invention" something finer or rarer than the construction
of a plot. The greatest workers in literature&mdash;we must
perhaps except Dante&mdash;have been the <i>trouvères</i>, the finders. To
form a being out of the clay, and to breathe into its nostrils the
breath of life is an act of creation in the finest sense of the word.
What is material and mechanical Shakespeare willingly accepts from
others; his range of invention is almost without limit, but it is invention
in the spiritual world. No sufficient sources have been
found for his earliest comedy&mdash;<i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>&mdash;and for
what was perhaps his latest&mdash;<i>The Tempest</i>; it does not follow,
however, that in these instances he varied from his customary
practice. When Shakespeare dealt with the substantial matter of
history, he remained upon his native soil, until through Plutarch he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
discovered Rome. No dramatist of his age is more truly an English
patriot; no other evocation of the past in poem or play is so
truly alive or so truly national as that effected in Shakespeare's
series of chronicle histories; and with his English history he has
connected his robustest piece of comedy&mdash;no romance of love, but
a comedy of character, essentially national in its humour, its exultant
mirth, its pathos, the chronicle history of King Falstaff on his
tavern throne. But breathing the air of the English Renaissance,
he turned away in his romantic comedies from his own country to
Italy, the land of romance. Once&mdash;in <i>Cymbeline</i>&mdash;he is a debtor
to Holinshed, but Holinshed has here to summon Boccaccio to his
aid. Even <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, as far as we can trace its
sources, is indebted for some of its laughable adventures to the Italian
<i>novelle</i>. Twice Shakespeare borrowed the plots of comedies
from tales by contemporary writers of England,&mdash;<i>As You Like It</i> is
founded upon Lodge's <i>Rosalynde</i>; <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, upon Greene's
<i>Pandosto</i>. But although Lodge's story was in part derived from a
poem of rough and humble incidents, characteristically English, it
was transformed in his hands into a much-embroidered amorous
pastoral of the Renaissance, and Greene's <i>Pandosto</i> is equally a product
of exotic southern culture.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, Bandello, Cinthio, elder English dramas derived from
Italian sources, Spanish pastoral romance&mdash;these furnished the
booty on which Shakespeare laid hands with the right of a conqueror.
He selected, omitted, altered, added, moulding the mass
of material with plastic hands, which are gentle because they are
strong. Frequently he complicates the intrigue; sometimes he
entangles a secondary plot with the primary; sometimes he emends
the ethics, or purifies the atmosphere, or saves some cherished character
from dishonour; in many instances he creates new personages,
who are the interpreters of his own wisdom or humour or gracious
temper. Thus in <i>As You Like It</i>, though the loves of Orlando and
Rosalind are transposed from the languid artificial pastoral of Lodge
into the spirited wood-notes of Shakespeare, we look in vain through
Lodge's romance for the sentimental-cynical Jaques, dilettante collector
of curious experiences, for Touchstone, the courtier-clown,
with his logic of nice distinctions, for Audrey, no Dresden-china
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
shepherdess, but fascinating to her ingenious suitor by virtue of her
robust charms and her flattering inferiority of brain. Again, in
<i>Twelfth Night</i> the character of Malvolio and of the whole group of
his tormentors&mdash;Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Fabian,
Feste, Maria&mdash;are added to his originals by Shakespeare. The
languorous love-in-idleness of the Duke Orsino, and Olivia's sadness
prepense demanded a contrast, and in Shakespeare's imagination
sprang up this crew of toper and droll and slender-witted
gentlemen, and mischief-loving maid, who seem to take hands and
dance around the solemn figure of that deluded magnifico of domestics.
To cite but one other example, how would <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i> dwindle if Beatrice and Benedick, its brain of wit and pulse
of gallantry, were to disappear from the scene! But these, and
with them the office-bearing majesty of Dogberry, prince of constables,
and the astute intelligence of goodman Verges ("an old man,
sir; but honest as the skin between his brows") are engrafted by
Shakespeare on the original of Bandello.</p>

<p><b>Relation to Predecessors and Contemporaries.</b>&mdash;From his predecessors
and early contemporaries Shakespeare doubtless learnt whatever
it was in their power to teach; at the same time he started
forth on ways of his own. In Lyly he saw how something of the
ideality of the masque could be transferred to comedy; how
comedy could escape from the grosser world of the actual to a
realm of courtly classical fantasy; how action could be suspended
to give scope for the play of sparkling or ingenious dialogue in
prose; how dainty song could come to the aid of speech which
threatened to grow tedious; how disguises of sex could lead to
delicate and diverting confusions. But Shakespeare must have
perceived the lack of human interest in Lyly's plays; the deficiency
of action, which often causes the progress of the piece to languish
or to cease; the slight or colourless characterization; the mechanical
artificiality, and monotonous balance of certain elements in
Euphuistic prose. What was sprightly and ingenious in Lyly's
dialogue he preserved; but of Euphuism in the strict sense we find
nothing in Shakespeare's plays, except a passage of mockery, appropriately
introduced where Falstaff in the tavern discourses as a
moralizing father to that well-bred youth, Prince Hal,&mdash;"For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows,
yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears." Nor, unless
it be the passage describing Oberon's vision of Cupid aiming his
shaft at the fair vestal throned in the West, does he follow Lyly
in mythological allegory, which conceals and betrays contemporary
persons and events.</p>

<p>In the comedies of Robert Greene examples already existed of
the romantic tale of love and lovers handled in dramatic fashion.
Amid the vulgar surroundings of his sorry London life, Greene
preserved a certain purity of idyllic imagination. His comely
maidens and loyal wives, tried and true, had shown how important
and how attractive a part may be borne by women upon the comic
stage. He had exhibited with some skill the art of connecting two
intrigues&mdash;the primary and the subordinate. He had placed comic
matter side by side with matter which approximated to tragic. He
could pass from verse to prose, and could mingle with blank verse,
sometimes brocaded with ornament but often fresh and sweet, easy
rhymed couplets and such other arrangements of rhyme as Shakespeare
practised in his early plays. But he often erred through an
attempt at Marlowesque magnificence and through the pride and
pomp of pseudo-classical decoration. He lacked that humour of
good sense, directed upon oneself, which warns a writer when he
is in danger of falling into absurdity. His ludicrous scenes do not
always assist the more serious or romantic matter of the play; they
are too much of the nature of an interlude or divertissement. His
feeling for what is laughable was somewhat primitive and crude;
a vigorous bout at quarter-staves, a lusty drubbing, the extravagant
pranks of a mediæval devil, were simple and unfailing receipts to
shake the ribs of the groundlings. If Shakespeare was a pupil of
Greene's in comedy, he was an intelligent pupil, who knew what
to remember and what to forget.</p>

<p>Except as regards the form of his verse and prose it cannot be
said that Shakespeare, as a writer of comedy, was ever in a true
sense in discipleship to any master. He found suggestions, and
used them, but he took his own way. The history of his development
consists in great measure in the gradual coalescing of the
various faculties from which poetry may be derived. In his latest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
comedies intellect and emotion are fused together; wit has been
taken up into moral wisdom; imagination in its highest reach is
united with the simple, primary feelings of our humanity; gaiety
and seriousness interpenetrate each other; tenderness and pity are
alive in the breast of the comic Muse; the laughter is often the
laughter of human sympathy and of a pathetic joy; if we smile at
the quaint forms of the hieroglyph of life, we know that it has a
deep and sacred meaning. From the outset Shakespeare thought
of comedy as a mirror of human life, which should reflect things
sad and serious as well as mirthful, and which by its magic power
should convert pain into pleasure; but the two elements of Shakespearian
comedy exist side by side in the earliest plays; they are
not yet fused into one. In the main, Shakespeare at first relied
upon his nimble brain, and aimed at exciting laughter by comic
surprises, contrasts, and incongruities which lie upon the surface
of things and are the offspring of accident rather than of character.
His delight in wit-combats and word-play is a transference to language
of the same feeling which made him delight in the errors and
disguisings of his persons. There is a laughter which arises from
no profounder cause than titillation; the harlequinade of words,
leaping one over the other, parrying, riposting, and suddenly disappearing
under a mask of invisibility, yet still striking, as it were,
out of the shadow, serves as a titillation of the brain.</p>

<p><b>Shakespeare's Development as a Comic Dramatist.</b>&mdash;In his earliest
group of comedies, <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>The
Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, dating perhaps
from about 1590 to about 1594, Shakespeare experimented in
various directions. We might name the group that of his transformation
plays. The comic surprise, the comic incongruity is that of
man suddenly converted from his true to a false self or from a false
self to a true. Human will is here the sport of nature or the sport
of accident. Nothing is but what is not. The vowed students of
Navarre are betrayed into the very opposite of their assumed selves
by the power of nature and of love. Proteus, the servant of Julia,
the comrade of Valentine, forsakes his mistress and his friend, and
is as suddenly reconverted. The brothers Antipholus and the
brothers Dromio are so shuffled together by the juggler Chance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
that we question if any personal identity will survive and reëmerge
at the close. Whether Lysander and Demetrius will awake the
rival lovers of Helena or the rival lovers of Hermia, or whether
Lysander will love Hermia and Demetrius Helena, depends on the
merest luck of fairy-land. But nature and luck are on the side of
love; all will be set right before the end. And because women lie
closer to nature than men, and their affections hold the bent with
the directness and certainty of nature, they are true and constant
to themselves, neither deluding their hearts with pseudo-ideals, nor
changed by the play of circumstances from what they are, but using
their woman's wit and woman's will to attain their proper ends.</p>

<p><i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> has the air of a young writer's effort to be
original, and to dazzle by unflagging cleverness; whence at times
a tedium of wit. Shakespeare seems to have resolved to owe his
plot to no man, with the result that it is somewhat too much a
prepared vehicle for the exposition of an idea. The little cloister
of culture, where education is to be a fine art removed from nature,
is invaded by woman, and with the entrance of woman enters
nature, which has more of wisdom to impart than all the academies
or schools. The denouement must be as original as the general
design; death arrives in the midst of mirth; there shall be no weddings
in the fifth act; love's labour is lost; or, if not lost, its reward
is deferred a twelvemonth; the scholars turned lovers are still infected
with something of unreality and affectation, exhaling their
sentiment in Petrarchan ingenuities, and one of them, Biron, with
his mocking humour, takes life too proudly and wilfully; the mad
girls of France are at heart serious, and they will test their lovers
by a year of genuine probation, then, and not till then, the marriage
bells shall ring. The Spanish fantastico, Don Adriano, towering
in stature, though not in wit, above his minion page, and the
learned schoolmaster Holofernes, much admired of his companion
pedant, the curate, resemble stock figures of Italian comedy.
Affectations of language&mdash;the decorated dialect of fashion, the
pedantries of scholarship not too profound&mdash;are also departures
from nature, and must submit to the laughter of good sense.
Nature may, indeed, be mended by art, for nature in its first rudiments,
as seen in honest Costard and goodman Dull, is not wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
a thing of beauty and of joy, but the art which mends nature must
be, as the wise Polixenes afterwards declared, an art that nature
makes. <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>&mdash;the <i>Precieuses ridicules</i> of Shakespeare,
but with men for the presenters of preciosity and women as
the exponents of good sense&mdash;is a comedy of dialogue rather than
of incident. The stage is kept alive with much tossing about of
brains in wit-encounters, with maskings and disguisings, and with
that marred show of the Nine Worthies, a heroi-comic forerunner
of the tedious, brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe,
in which the hard-handed men of Athens appear before Duke
Theseus.</p>

<p><i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is a comedy of incident. Here Shakespeare
accepts his plot, his chief characters, and their adventures
from Plautus. But the adventures are complicated by his addition
of the two Dromios, which more than doubles the possibilities of
ludicrous confusion. The fun cannot be too fast or furious; the
unexpected always happens; the discovery is staved off to the fifth
act with infinite skill; the nearer each brother approaches his fellow,
the more impossible it becomes for them to meet. Nowhere has
Shakespeare ravelled and unravelled the threads of an intrigue with
such incomparable dexterity as in this early play. But <span class="err" title="original: Shakepeare's">Shakespeare's</span>
imagination could not rest satisfied with a farce, however
laughable or however skilfully conducted. His vein of lyrical poetry
breaks forth in the love-episode, for the sake of which he created
Luciana. And he has set the entire comic business in a romantic
and pathetic framework&mdash;the story of the afflicted old Ægeon and
the Ephesian abbess, in whom he discovers his lost wife. The
play opens with grief and the doom of death impending over an
innocent life; it closes, after a cry of true pathos, with reconciling
joy, and the interval is filled with laughter that peals to a climax.
This is not the manner of Plautus; but laughter with Shakespeare
would seem hard and barren&mdash;the crackling of thorns under a
pot,&mdash;if it were wholly isolated from grief and love and joy.</p>

<p>Shakespeare did not again attempt the comedy of mere incident.
In <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> he struck into his favourite tune&mdash;the
comedy of romance. Among its sources is the Spanish
pastoral of Jorge de Montemayor, but the scene is Italy, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
woman-country wooed in this play before it was wed by the imagination
of its poet in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. The theme is love,
its fidelity and its infidelity&mdash;love with its incalculable surprises,
love with its unalterable constancy. The characters are lightly yet
gracefully outlined; there are the grave and reverend seniors; the
contrasted pairs of lovers; the waiting-woman; and the clownish
men-servants, to whom the business of laughter is intrusted. The
persons are somewhat mechanically set over, one against the other,&mdash;Valentine
the loyal against the fickle Proteus, Silvia the sprightly
against the tender Julia, Speed the professional wit against Launce
the unconscious humourist, whose filial affections and amorous
desires for the milkmaid, who has more qualities than a water-spaniel,
are only secondary to his devotion to the cur Crab, a dog,
indeed, to whose share some canine errors fall, but endowed with
more qualities than a wilderness of milkmaids. The disguising of
Julia in masculine attire anticipates many such disguisings in later
comedies. It is no frolic masking like that of the girls of France,
but part of the serious-playful romance of a woman's brave and
gentle heart. The blank verse is sweet and regular rather than
swift or powerful in dramatic movement; rhyme is less frequently
used than heretofore; the prose of Launce's soliloquies has a
homely directness and vigour.</p>

<p>In <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> comedy becomes lyrical. Character
is subordinate to incident, but incident here has a dreamlike
quality, which unites itself with the poetry of a fantastic world. It
is a comedy of errors,&mdash;the errors of a night,&mdash;but the confusions
are not external and material as in the adventures of the brothers
Antipholus; they are inward and psychological; the bewilderment
is one of passions, not of persons. The triumph of the poet lies
before all else in the power which he shows of harmonizing materials
seemingly the most incongruous. The magnificence of Theseus
and his Amazonian bride,&mdash;power in the full tide of prosperity,&mdash;the
crossed and wayward loves of youths and maidens, the minikin-mighty
strifes of fairy-land and its roguish sports, the artistic
pains and illustrious ineptitude of the crew of hempen homespuns&mdash;all
these are wrought together in a dream which we accept with
a tranquil and delighted wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>

The power of the human will is, as it were, suspended in this
play of elfland magic. Before <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> was written,
Shakespeare's feeling for dramatic action and passion had been
deepened and invigorated by his progress in dealing with English
history and probably by the creation of a great tragedy, <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, the tragedy of love and youth and death. <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i> is Shakespeare's first, and perhaps his most remarkable, example
of the comedy of character. Here we pass from the realm
of caprice to that of human volition. A passive object, the merchant,
is placed in the midst as a prize to be contended for by
forces naturally adverse&mdash;the passion of concentrated revenge and
the spirit of charity, armed with the brightest weapons of intelligence.
The masculine and the feminine powers enter upon a
single combat, and victory remains with mercy and love, the "Ewigweibliche."
No such figure as that of Shylock had previously
appeared upon the English stage. In his person Shakespeare not
only lays bare the nerve and muscle of a wrestler in the game of
life, but studies the darker and sadder features of a race. He is
no incredible monster like the Barabas of Marlowe, but a man,
whose origins and environment have made him what he is; whom,
therefore, we understand and whom in his very pitilessness we are
constrained to pity. Nor had the English stage hitherto seen any
woman so complex in her various powers of intellect, emotions,
will, so single in their harmonious coöperance, as the noble lady of
Belmont. The same energy of resolve which makes her the armed
champion of Antonio had lain hidden in her loyalty to the arduous
conditions of her father's will. The dramatist in this play postulates
our acceptance of certain external improbabilities; these concessions
made, all things are wrought out in accordance with the
laws of life. The spirit of tragedy here is neighbour to the comic
spirit, yet observes the finest decorum. Two actions&mdash;that of the
caskets and that of the pound of flesh&mdash;work into each other
without a jar and become one. The characters are grouped with
perfect freedom and with an exact, though unobtruded, ordonnance,
for Shakespeare's art had now learnt to conceal itself. The
fifth act of the play is a kind of lovely epilogue, where, after the
strained anxiety of the trial-scene, joy is preserved from its own
excess by the instinct of self-mockery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>

It may be that the humbler humorous scenes of the English
historical plays on which he was now engaged drew down the
imagination of Shakespeare as a writer of comedy from romance to
realism, and made him content to work for a little while in rougher
material. <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, whatever its chronological
place may be, is only a spirited adaptation of an older play, and is
chiefly interesting as an example of Shakespeare's art in transposing,
developing, enriching with detail, the ideas of a predecessor, and as
a demonstration of the temper with which he could kindle a predecessor's
<i>allegro</i> into an <i>allegro con brio</i>. With old Sly's son of Burton
heath, the village sot, he was upon his native soil, and he could
heighten his original with low-life reminiscences of Warwickshire
taverns. <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> is a direct offshoot from the
greater comedy of Falstaff which is incorporated in the historical
plays. The tradition that it was hastily written by command of
Queen Elizabeth, who desired to see "Falstaff in love," relieves us
from the necessity of supposing that Shakespeare voluntarily degraded
his indomitable jester into the flouting-stock of a bourgeois
fabliau, "Well I am your theme: you have the start of me; I am
dejected; ... ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me; use me as
you will." That Shakespeare should throw himself with spirit into
his task was a crime for which he earns our forgiveness by its successful
issue. The merry wives are honest buxom dames, without a
grain of real malice in them. The French physician and the Welsh
parson murder the Queen's English with as happy a valiance as that
of Fluellen and the Princess Katharine in <i>King Henry V.</i> Slender
is the most delightfully incompetent of wooers&mdash;a Romeo <i>manqué</i>
of Windsor, whose amorous passion waits upon his cousin Shallow's
promptings and whose wit is mislaid with his Book of Riddles.
The buck-basket and the old woman of Brentford are very palpable
jokes, which the crassest gentleman-usher or emptiest-headed maid-in-waiting
could not miss. There are the proper topical allusions
to call forth an interchange of smiling mutual intelligence. Altogether
<i>The Merry Wives</i> was a comedy delicate enough for a
queen. For such a play the proper medium was prose; verse is
reserved for the slender love-episode of Fenton and Anne Page,
and for the scenes connected with the fairy disguising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>

As the pressure of the English historical plays lightened, Shakespeare
could turn again to Italy and to romance. In <i>The Merry
Wives</i> he had grouped his characters in a circle around a gross old
self-lover, whom it was their business to delude and mock. Perhaps
the same device could be refined upon and turned to romantic
uses. Falstaff had professed love and had been convicted of sordid
self-interest. What it a pair of high-spirited persons, touched with
the egotism of self-sufficingness and wilful wit, and professing a
superiority to the toys of lovers, could be ensnared into that deep
mutual passion which was in truth written for them in the book of
fate? But there must be something deeper here than a jest; such
brave union of hearts must be cemented by a common effort to
confront the sorrow of the world. At this time, perhaps, Shakespeare
was concerned with his revision of <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>.
Might not Biron and Rosaline be reincarnated, and in place of that
crude test of a twelve months' visitation of the speechless sick
decreed for Biron, might not an immediate test of valiant manhood
be discovered, and the newer Biron come to the happy ending of
love's labour's won? In Beatrice and Benedick a brilliant centre
was found for the play of <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>. The high spirits,
which gave life to <i>The Shrew</i> and <i>The Merry Wives</i> are here refined
by gallantry and beauty, wit and grace, and by the presence of
injury and pain. The other <i>dramatis personæ</i> gather around the
hero and heroine to beguile them into love; the passion begotten
of a jest is brought forth in sorrow, and sorrow at the close is converted
into joy. With so much of quick and lambent dialogue as
Beatrice and Benedick have to utter, we want no outstanding jester
here; his speech would be an impertinence; but we need a counterfoil
to wit in the unconscious humour of a Dogberry and a Verges;
and these worthies assist effectively in the action of the play; Fate,
the sphinx, assumes an ironic smile; the dulness of a blundering
watchman unties a knot which has foiled the dexterity of the wise.</p>

<p>The comedy which followed <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> is one of
sunshine and dappled shadow under the greenwood of Arden. Landseer's
companion pictures, "War" and "Peace," find a parallel in
Shakespeare's <i>King Henry V.</i> and <i>As You Like It</i>, which probably
belong to the same year; and the scene of both the history and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
comedy is laid in France. He would have left untouched a favourite
theme of the Renaissance if he had wholly neglected the pastoral;
but Shakespeare felt that the conventional pastoral alone, with its
cruel shepherdess and sighing swain, however suitable for a piece
of poetical tapestry, could not furnish the life and body and movement
demanded by the stage. His Silvius and Phœbe, Arcadians
of the mode and rhetoricians in verse, are presented with a certain
reserved irony; the veritable rustics are William, whose pretty wit
chiefly manifests itself in monosyllabic answers, and the wench
Audrey, whom the gods did not make poetical. Touchstone, a
clown among courtiers, is a courtier among clowns. The other
persons of the comedy are of the high-bred class, in the midst of
which the dramatist's imagination moved with most pleasure, but
here they are transported into a delightful open-air environment,
which breathes a freshness and sweetness into their spirits. "Sweet
are the uses of adversity," and especially of such adversity as that
of Rosalind, which enables her, in her disguise as Ganymede, to
assist in her own wooing and to play the part of a benevolent goddess
of destiny for several pairs of lovers including Orlando and
herself. We learn from a play of Ben Jonson's of the same date
that melancholy was a genteel fashion of the day. Shakespeare, on
the suggestion of a current affectation, created in Jaques a character
which was wholly original. Humourist, sentimentalist, critic, and
cynic, he is the self-conscious seeker for new experiences, the
dilettante collector of curiosities to be labelled in his museum as
states of a human soul.</p>

<p>The midsummer of Shakespeare's comedy is reached in <i>Twelfth
Night</i>. Was it his effort to resist the invasion of sadder thought
which raised its mirth to the reeling heights of Sir Toby's Illyrian
bacchanals? We dare not venture such a surmise, for the light
and warmth are at flood-tide. The voluptuous love-languors of
the Duke and Olivia's luxury of grief fatten the idle soil for the
blossoming of the rose. The disease of overmuch prosperity in
the palaces of Illyria seems set over against the sanity of adversity
in the forest of Arden. Viola, in her disguises as Cesario, has a
harder task than the banished Rosalind; for instead of assisting at
her own wooing, she is required to plead as an envoy of love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
against herself. In place of the dilettante egotist Jaques, who
would range through all experiences, we have here the solemn self-lover,
Malvolio, pinnacled in his own sense of importance and his
code of formal propriety, yet toppling from his heights to so grotesque
a fall. Had Shakespeare encountered some starched Elizabethan
Puritan, who looked sourly on the theatre, and thought that
because he was virtuous there should be no more cakes and ale,
and did the dramatist read a humorous lesson to his time on an
error more deep-seated in the human heart than the excesses of a
joyous temper? Was the comic spirit here a swordsman armed
with the blade of reason and good sense? If such was the case,
Shakespeare was assuredly no partisan, and Sir Toby Belch is hardly
his ideal representative of a liberal humanism.</p>

<p>After the play of <i>Twelfth Night</i> we become aware of the first
ebb of summer. It has been suggested that the events shadowed
forth in the <i>Sonnets</i> took some of the joy out of Shakespeare's heart.
It has been suggested that the fall of Essex, involving the disgrace
of the poet's patron Southampton, tended to embitter his spirit.
These are conjectures that cannot be verified. What is certain is,
that he turned toward tragedy, and that his temper in comedy indicates
a gathering of the clouds. The spirit of <i>All's Well that Ends
Well</i> is as courageous as is the title of the play; and there is a
need for courage, not of the gay and sportive kind, but serious and
steadfast. The hero is no gallant Orlando or high-spirited Benedick.
He has in him, we must suppose, the possibilities of noble
manhood, but these are obscured by the errors and the vices of
youth. The heroine is no glad-hearted girl like Rosalind, no
scatterer of coruscating jests like Beatrice, but a woman, clear-sighted,
strong-willed, and bent on achieving her purpose. She,
the poor daughter of a physician, is a healer in a world that stands
in need of healing. The bright-winged Cupid of nods and becks
and wreathed smiles has been transformed into Love, the physician.
Helena, honoured and cherished by all who know her aright, is
rejected by the one man on whom her heart is fixed, and whom she
rescues from his baser self with something of that maternal protectiveness,
which in certain instances constitutes the nucleus of
wifely love. The Countess is Shakespeare's creation, and nowhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
has he made age more beautiful. The comic business lies chiefly
in the unmasking of the pretender, Parolles. It is required both
by the action and the ethics of the play, but there is little to afford
us pleasure in the humiliation of so paltry a <i>miles gloriosus</i>.</p>

<p>The atmosphere darkens in <i>Measure for Measure</i>. In the city
of Vienna corruption boils and bubbles. From the Duke's deputy
to the lowest drudge of vice, society is infected with the festering
evil. To deal with the subtleties of sin, virtue itself must learn
crafty ways; mines must be opposed by countermines. In Claudio
the passions of youth, snatching too eagerly at unlicensed satisfaction,
are brought into the presence of death; and to life, tender and
florid, the vast regions of the grave are full of obscurity and uncertain
horror. It is hardly a scene for the joy of love, though to
two strong hearts love may come in the end as the sequel of a
common struggle for justice and moral reformation. Rather is it
a place for the trials and the victory of virgin chastity. The Duke
moves through subterranean passages, guided by the dark lantern
of moral prudence. Isabella illuminates the gloom with the light
of an indignant saintliness. Here it is no pompous formalist who
is humiliated; no common pretender who is detected and delivered
over to laughter; the deadliest ambushes of evil are attacked; the
heart, "deceitful above all things and desperately wicked," is laid
bare. Angelo, the self-deceiver, is exposed not merely to others,
but to himself; he gazes down appalled into the abyss discovered
in his own soul. We have travelled far from the fresh wild-wood
paths of Arden and from the glowing gardens of Illyria.</p>

<p>No problems connected with the plays of Shakespeare are more
difficult of solution than those offered by the satiric drama, in which
matter from the story of Troy is handled in so enigmatic a fashion.
Shall we place <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> hard by <i>Measure for Measure</i>, or
date it some six years later, regarding it as a successor in comedy
to the tragic study of the misanthrope in <i>Timon of Athens</i>? The
evidence inclines in favour of the earlier date. Is some of the
wood, hay, and stubble of the lost <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> of Dekker
and Chettle imbedded in Shakespeare's play? Is it a satire of
humanity or of contemporary individuals? Was this the "purge"
which Shakespeare administered to Ben Jonson, and, with Jonson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
disguised as Ajax, and Marston as Thersites, was the play one of
those alarums and excursions connected with the war of the
theatres, in which Marston, Dekker, and Jonson were the principal
combatants?<a name="FNanchor_1949_1949" id="FNanchor_1949_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949_1949" class="fnanchor">[1949]</a> Is Cressida a malicious portrait of the deceitful
enchantress of the <i>Sonnets</i>, and was a satirical presentment of the
heroes of Homer a retort upon the rival poet, conjectured to be
Chapman, the translator of Homer, who had stolen away the
favour of Shakespeare's young friend and patron. These questions
remain unanswered. We can only say that the spirit of this
comedy of disillusion is alien to that of genuine comedy as conceived
by Shakespeare in his happier days. The young love of
Troilus is betrayed by the courtesan born. Achilles is a dull-brained
fellow, barren of wit, who sulks or wantons in his tent;
Ajax is a clumsy elephant; Thersites lives on garbage, and spews
his filth; Pandar is a lecher, incapable except by proxy; to fight on
account of Helen is to set the world at odds for an harlot, yet on
her behalf it is that Hector, knowing the folly of it, dies. Troilus
is indeed a gallant youth, but his passion is a greenhorn's infatuation:
let him be cured of it by surgical incision, however cruel!
Shall we say that <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> and <i>Measure for Measure</i> are
connected by a certain contrast and resemblance? In each the
world is bubbling with corruption. The mighty persons of the
earth in the one play are as ignoble as the mean persons of the other;
the confraternity of Mistress Overdone includes the champions of
the world and their renowned lady-loves; the worldly wisdom of the
Duke is lowered and broadened into the all-embracing but wholly
mundane experience of Ulysses; and in this sorry society it is from
worldly wisdom alone that we can hope for any rescue or deliverance,
for here we find no saintly Isabella, but a Cressida, offering
her lips to every solicitor of the Grecian tents.</p>

<p>The spirit of mirth withdrew itself for a time from Shakespeare's
art. He could still write comic scenes, but they were used to
deepen the effects of tragedy. The grave-diggers of <i>Hamlet</i>, the
porter turning the key of hell-gate on the night of murder in <i>Macbeth</i>,
Lear's poor fool jesting across the storm upon the heath, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
clown whose basket of figs conceals the worm of Nilus&mdash;these are
humorous figures created in the service of pity and terror. Shakespeare
did not return to comedy until his perception of the world
and human life had been purified by the tragic <i>katharsis</i>. With
every faculty of his mind labouring at its highest, he had pursued
a long dramatic inquisition of the evil that is in the world and in
the heart of man. He had not retreated into any facile creed of
pleasant optimism, but boldly explored the face of night, and night
had brought out the stars. Such love as that of Cordelia, such
loyalty as that of Kent, could be fully revealed only in and through
the darkness. Man pleased Shakespeare and woman also, when he
wrote his tragedies, else the players would have had lenten entertainment;
for a drama founded upon misanthropy would have been
unendurable. In <i>Timon of Athens</i> the poet exhibits misanthropy as
the evasion of weakness from the ruins of a self-indulgent optimism,
and we may say that in <i>Timon of Athens</i> he bade farewell to gloom.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's latest comedies&mdash;<i>Pericles</i>(as far as it is his), <i>Cymbeline</i>,
<i>The Winter's Tale</i>, <i>The Tempest</i>&mdash;form a group, which is
distinguished by a special character. The atmosphere is light and
pellucid, like that which follows a thunder-storm. There is a great
and wide serenity abroad; the heavens seem more spacious, and
they bend down to embrace the margins of the land. The healing
influences of nature are felt in the country lanes where Autolycus
sings his tirra-lirra, and the meadows where Perdita follows her
sheep, on the seacoast of Tarsus where Marina bears her basket
of flowers, among the wild Welsh mountains with the gallant sons
of Cymbeline, on the enchanted island full of "sounds and sweet
airs that give delight and hurt not." The life of cities and courts
had lost much of its attraction for one who perhaps was now finding
repose and restoration among the Warwickshire fields. But
Shakespeare did not plead, in the manner of Rousseau, for a reversion
to the primitive conditions of humanity; he could smile at
Gonzalo's imaginary commonwealth, where property has no existence;
he saw in Caliban the rudimentary man not half informed
with soul; he had faith in an art which mends nature, while yet it
is an art which nature makes. And nature itself, with all of human
life, seems to hang, dreamlike and yet real, in the encompassing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
power of something that is above nature and that means well, however
little we can trace its ways. Dian appears to Pericles in a
vision, guiding him to her temple where joy awaits him; the innocence
of Hermione is vindicated by the oracle of Apollo; Posthumus
in prison is visited by Jupiter, giving him assurance of divine
succour&mdash;"whom best I love I cross"; Prospero is aided in his
beneficent designs by ministering elemental spirits. The growing
resources of the Jacobean stage assisted the dramatist in scenic
effects, to which he imparted a beautiful significance. The temper
of these latest plays is a temper of reconciliation; the wrongs of
life are present, but for those who can transcend the baser passions
they work for good. Injuries are felt but are forgiven; broken
bonds of affection are reunited; the lost are restored to hearts that
have loved and suffered. "The oldest hath borne most," says
Albany in the closing lines of <i>King Lear</i>. The old are seen in
these last romances of Shakespeare as experienced in suffering,
caused by the offence of others or by the errors of their own hearts;
but they have learnt through suffering a certain detachment from
the greed of personal gain, and they lean over the joy of young
hearts, still immersed in the innocent egoism of youth, with a fond
protectiveness. Cymbeline and his recovered sons, Pericles and
Marina, Hermione and Perdita, Prospero and Miranda&mdash;it is the
same sentiment, varied and repeated, in each of its exemplars. Certain
indications that Shakespeare was loosening his connection with
the theatre are present in these plays. He could, as in the instance
of <i>Pericles</i> and perhaps in those of <i>King Henry VIII.</i> and <i>The Two
Noble Kinsmen</i> contribute fragments to a drama in which, as a whole,
he took little interest. In plays of which he is the sole author, his
dramatic energy flags at times, to be renewed where the subject
moved his feelings or charmed his imagination. The versification
is breeze-like in its freedom, but sometimes the breeze falls away
and sometimes it wanders with too vague an aim. The treatment
of time passes from the extreme of romantic license, as in <i>The
Winter's Tale</i>, to the strictest observation of the rule of unity in
<i>The Tempest</i>. In <i>Pericles</i>, the earliest of these romances, Shakespeare
cared only for certain scenes and situations. In <i>Cymbeline</i>,
wherever Imogen, the loveliest figure in his gallery of portraits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
women appears, we are certain to receive his finest workmanship.
Hermione and Perdita wholly possessed his imagination, while a
crude sketch sufficed for the jealousy of Leontes. <i>The Tempest</i>, if
we set aside the laborious jesting of Antonio and Sebastian (designed
to express the barren brain that often accompanies a callous heart),
is wrought with equal power from the first scene to the last.</p>

<p>Perhaps the conjecture is well founded that <i>The Tempest</i>, with its
masque of wedding blessings, was written for the marriage of Princess
Elizabeth to Frederick, Elector Palatine, in February, 1613.
Perhaps it was Shakespeare's latest play. And it may not be altogether
an idle notion of the poet Campbell, that in Prospero's
breaking his magic staff and dismissing his airy spirits we have the
farewell to the stage of the great enchanter who had summoned
Prospero into being.</p>

<p>Shakespeare found poetic comedy in its rudiments; he left it
fully formed. He brought together its various elements and organized
them to fulfil the functions of a single living spirit. He
made laughter wise, and taught seriousness how to be winning and
gracious. Through no ascetic doctrine but by virtue of the spirit
of life and beauty he purified the drama from the dulness of what
is gross, and kept its temper above the seductions of sentimental
morals and a nerveless lubricity. Wit, fancy, grace, constructive
dexterity, are found among his successors. Shakespeare's sane outlook
upon life as a whole, his gentleness of strength in dealing with
the passions, his reserve of power, his moral wisdom, were lost to
English comedy when Prospero abjured his magic and retired to the
duties of his Stratford lordship of the soil.</p>
